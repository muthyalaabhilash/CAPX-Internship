"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 15, 2024","this is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme

most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports

expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well

but growth stocks dont rely so much on eps or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count  going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future

value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both eps  revenue  youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never invest in a company solely for its dividend

the market does need strong and trusted institutions will it price in the potential risks of this cabinet  removed  can someone check on the guy who bought 100k in itm asts calls expiring in dec yesterday because i dont think that guy is having a good day   what a pfun day to own pfizer yay  tdw is almost below 50 at this point you will make a killing on leaps when oil prices rebound or sell puts 6 months to a year out currently you can secure a 1200 premium at 60 strike for puts expiring in may thats nuts considering the average true range of the stock tdw can realistically return to 60 in 35 days off good news however its being priced like the company is going bankrupt

if the sp fills the gap to the downside there will be a ton of great stocks at a discount that got disproportionately pummeled by bearish sentiment  recommendations for next week

 novartis  puts 100 strike december 24 expiration wait until after it breaks the 8day ema to the upside
 cigna  puts 315 strike december 6th expiration after the gap up it was rejected at the 50 and 200 ema simultaneously ci is currently sitting at the 8day ema get in if it breaks and finishes below that point 
 tandem diabetes  puts 29 strike december 24 wait for it to finish above the 8day ema
 nasdaq inc  calls 80 strike december 24 between november 15th and the 30th it has gone up 23 years straight for an average of 132  days where nvda is red and im green are my favorite  deleted  thoughts on meta  smh on sale  planning to make my taxable accounts just index and then do individual stocks in my irá in case i need to sell do that im tax efficient  is it smart to dump 10k into voo at these levels ive been watching it hoping for a dip buts its just been going up when will it be on sale  all i want for christmas is some balls so i can short pltr god i wish i wasnt such a coward   that deleted tweet from earlier today by a pltr exec who also deleted their account was about the most 2021 thing ive seen since the feb 2021 bloomberg article about people calling cathie wood money tree which turned out to be about a week away from the arkk top

httpsxcombuccocapitalstatus1857520992437887443  well that was awful  hello oh hi 1999 this is pltr answering  i was busy rating penises what happened today  reminder that even after this weeks pullback valuations are still in the 95th percentile and for those of you keep referring to the devaluation of the dollarincrease in money supply why havent those had an equally material impact on earnings per share as they have on share prices  you know its a clown market when meme stocks are at ath  pltr rklb and others and everything else is selling off  market is setting up for a monster santa rally  nwpx just jumped 11 premarket not complaining but struggling to see what caused it  mda space with some strong earnings

niche insurer mainly in new york a lot of big names are pulling out of the region leaving a vacuum for them to fill 

theyre also divesting assets in other areas that havent worked out as well for them 

interesting short to mid term play as they have incredible combined ratios indicating good underwriting  tlt still getting monkey hammered on the edge of 450  today were announcing major changes to our mission at abl we are stepping away from the commercial launch market and focusing our efforts on missile defense


another one bites the dust what rklb did in even small launch very impressive when so many who raised as much or more didnt get anywhere near their outcomes  deleted  sold hsy puts for a 180 gain  lly getting pounded  my precious csiq  thoughts on moderna this cheap theyve had a shit year but are nearly back to early 2020 prices if they have great vaccines drugs coming down the pipeline id hope it has some potential there  bidask spreads are going haywire in the final few minutes  anyone looking to get in to lbrt liberty energy since their ceo is the new appointee of the doe im long on energy anyways im also not saying any funny business will be going on but were all human  sunnova is the next sunpower  0

remember sunpower spwr they filed for bankruptcy back in mid july im here to tell you why sunnova is next 
ive worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealersinstallers all year robbing peter to pay paul sunnova is basically a ponzi scheme at this point search redditfacebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and its a pretty open secret 

nova holds approximately 798 billion in total debt this represents a 2533 increase over the past year contributing to a debttoequity ratio of 458 which is significantly above industry norms

they currently sit at a 485 million market cap eerily similar to sunpower before they went under it is only a matter of time for sunnova most dealersinstallers are moving all of their volume away from using them as theyve been late on payments instead of the reps getting paid upon install they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing the last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new sunnova ppasloans 

sunnova holds an insane amount of debt i honestly have no idea how they are still afloat i didnt think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year their free cash flow is in the toilet

sunnova energy international nova reported a negative free cash flow fcf of approximately 213 billion over the trailing 12 months this figure is derived from an operating cash flow of 28275 million and capital expenditures totaling 185 billion the significant cash burn highlights the companys capitalintensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations

i know what youre thinking their stock is already down massively since the election yes that was based on all solar stocks dropping sunrun which i believe will be around for the long haul also dropped like a rock however i believe within 6 months sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0 
i dont think trump will kill the solar tax credit however it wont matter for sunnova their ceo is a former enron exec this company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat has worked for far longer than it should have their partnership with home depot has largely been a dud nothing like sunruns partnership with costco 

unless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1 in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts

zoomed out im still up 7 for the month and 30 ytd when and if my portfolio goes lower next week and beyond will just have to keep reminding myself to zoom out and its healthy looking from that pov  never been so pleased to be 60 sp   y red  its so over  google never ceases to disappoint me  how cooked are healthcare stocks with rfk jr at hhs seeing pfe and mrna getting absolutely killed and ive given up my gains on lly since it last dipped to 780  lrcx is almost trading at 52 wk lows now  deleted  puts back on the menu boys  nibbled some more asml and lrcx really not in a rush though unless nvda blows it out of the water not sure semis turn around fast  i hate googling meta stock and seeing that same god damn eu extortion headline all over the place  if we get a significant pullback would be amazing for me  root rklb pltr carry my portfolio today
edit also mstr app  am i reading correctly that pltr has a pe of 307 and a market cap of 150b  from a vague standpoint what is the future of america in terms of stocks

obviously tech i would say is number 1 but what else is worthwhile that our country will heavily focus on 1020 years down the road  after all that hype from reddit oklo is tanking  sold out all my adbe while i am only down 3 just gonna let it sit in mmf as i look for better deals ive never had this much cash in my portfolio  in good news epd looks like its going to stick above 30 only took you a couple of years  might go long on efx equifax good service credit ratings company with oligopoly  ive been waiting for a nice medp entry point trimmed some strl hcc and lrn gains to get the cash to pick up 15 shares of medp  also eyeing amat or onto at these prices cant afford both but tempted to pick up one of them  i was admittedly waaay to heavy into amat thinking about selling half or 34 and diversifying the funds through the next few days into other semis  my sartorius stedim getting hit by rfk lol what a world we live in  whats happening with amazon  thoughts on elf beauty solid earnings  deleted  mstr to infinity proof that ponzi can outperform any bad investment bad trader

dd is meaningless all you need to get rich quick is to have faith that dollar isnt real  app mstr x30 in 2 years and surpass 100b cap buy high fly higher  gotta love this rug pull

they lied to everyone saying that spx would be 6300 through the santa rally

maybe 6000 was the top  rough week but it was due regardless of whether the rally continues things were getting a bit too crazy my guess is thats enough of a drop and we have a nice week next week and the overall upward trend continues into next year  my mexico and europe green usa red feels nice that is at least possible lol if rare i am about 5050 at this point usa vs international  spectacular drop in semi cap at what level does all the china risk get priced in  im a glutton for punishment my limit buy of 200 shares of celh  255 triggered in my roth account looks to be the low of the day jake paul and tyson fight is going to be watched bigly across the world tonight via nflx and theyre the main sponsor pep headwinds should be winding down 2025 will be the start of their turnaround i know some people are probably tired of hearing about this stock but i just think this is one where the market is getting it wrong right now  bought amzn at 214 gifemotefree_emotes_packlaughing  any decent stocks down 40 or more from ath  why is standard aero missing from google stocks

the mexican airport beatings will continue until reddit gets bearish i suppose  the big theme next week is real estate and homebuilders there will some good trading and btd opportunities  sunrun drop is an absolute joke  whats you guys take on vistry vtyl

uk homebuilder in the process of switching to an nvr style capital light model they have a couple of exnvr board members on the board recently had to do two profit warnings because one of their divisions understated building costs did a full external audit of all projects and fired the managment responsible so things look fine i think stock cratered to prices seen last in 2023  nice is underrated ai stock  i bought save calls prior to bankruptcy proceedings fidelity shows them under the new ticker saveq and has a value of 02 pegged to them yahoo lists them trading at about 40  how do i trade these on the otc market  why did nvmi lost like 30 in recent days even if it beat estimates for q3  there was a huge buy order at the close for around 2 million shares of smci today

sorry cant post the screenshot here because of low karma  was trying to buy back lunr at around 757 est and robinhoods system flagged me as a pdt but it fell off after a minute due to account size but by that time it was too late  a buy order at 1222 was now unavailable as something maybe the order below moved the ask up to 1230 and it hit 8pm live  learn

what has to happen to get the former glory back     are the troubles over for smci anyone know the date for revised legit audited results 


pe 15 for the 3 supplier to nvda seems at least ⅓ the fair price it should command if the numbers are legit  how does dis keep mooning these past week earnings were mediocre guidance barely adequate growth slowed to a crawl on a company with 41 pe google and meta went down on better earning calls plus they have saner pes

not to mention the new government having a hate boner for disney as it is 

i dont get it  can someone explain it to me like i am an idiot because i sort of am when it comes to stocks

why is the market in the shits today  oil dropping  amzn relapsed w mckenzie cancer  glad i dumped google for a profit cash gang is back  its a pretty good day for my att and british tobacco stocks  tlt which i btd on this morning is now green as well  my port is up 040 today timing the market  time in the market  is voo a good buy at 539 or wait s bit longer   tsm a long termroth buy at these levels  palantir pltr up 140 sell half and let the rest run  love how zim is green on days like this in only two weeks ill be able to realize a 150 long term gain on this stock dont think i ever heard a good thing about it here and yet its probably my best performing pick  what is going to the moon next besides elons rocketwhich is actually going to mars  market flipped fast bears in charge now  whats going on with google any recent bearish news  rddt a long termroth buy at these levels  deleted  hey guys in light of microstrategys major success  i wanted to call attention to thumzup media tzuphttpswwwglobenewswirecomnewsrelease2024111529819220enthumzupboardofdirectorsapprovesbitcoinastreasuryreserveassethtml this is a very cheap stock that will acquire bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset i think if you missed the mstr hype this stock is an early cheap way to get into the scene let me know your thoughts  just wanted that sweet 6000 lol market seems like it wants to hold around here  whats up with the lulu disney collab seems kinda flat but im not the audience anyone have thoughts  a friend whos more knowledgeable on this stuff than me said to invest in fxaix and voo i rarely have seen people talk about fxaix i have about 300 dollars worth of each i plan to put more in which should i go for or should i split 5050  i bought vti at 297 am i fucked  any chance of nvda getting caught cooking the books just like smci  geez no signs of slowing down every day is more red than the one previous   lly dumping since rfk is about to make america skinny again  a lot here buying semi you know what that means  wal mart at 700 billion or costco at 400 billion or target at 72 billion wouldnt we want to be invested in target more  in my portfolio rddt is the only stock in red today thinking sell some and buy winner  lol  im a little new to this so i might ask silly questions

what are the short term forecast for sp 500 can it still make the 6k by year end ik nvidia and nadasq probably goingt o have a big night can still rally sp 500 a bit and estabilish the bullish run   this year is reversed no spooktober but also no santa rally as it looks like warnings signs are still here only question is if they get validated lmao  would you invest in stock that is about to be delisted  

why or why not

any grave dancers out there for super micro  whoever didnt let nvda drop below 140 i curse you and your family  i just bought more tlt  interest rates will move lower stocks however may not move higher for awhile as we are in a bubble  onto is my next target i honesty dodged a bullet with the sell off i bought the peak in july and then sold it in august might have to buy at these levels and hold for a while the industry shifting over to more packaging will pay off massively for onto especially with all of these acquisitions theyve been making  this is a nice accumulation period i would say amat dropped to a reasonable valuation and ive been buying today underperformance in the stock price in the short term obfuscates the long term growth potential i am limiting my overall semi equipment exposure after asml got battered postearnings though  what makes onto stand out from other semi makers and whats with their dilution  im officially out of on sold at 72  looking for reentry again if it touches 59  you need to time the market if you buy individual stocks not timing only work in index and etfs  i fund two roths every january fully and than only buy 300 in taxable every quarter


simple and easy  i have a few anti bubble stocks bti wm pge ko i even feel like to an extent but tobacco has been the best performer of my small bunch  this is a joke right i seriously cant tell anymore  well the onion bought alex jones infowars yesterday so i guess anything can happen  those pickspardons sound a lot less ridiculous than this weeks latest trump gems of cynical stupidity its tough to effectively parody a buffoon sorry for the political spin but many stocks will be affected by these things come 25  not gonna lie you had me there for a second actually be right back i have to go read the news and make sure you arent serious  apparently gaetz was an off the cuff pick on his plane that his transition team wasnt even vetting  hi sir you must have something better than app would you like to share with us  advanced money destroyer gotta pick up intels slack  deleted  ive been buying im not a big fish but ive been buying a share every week the past month or so

i believe these new drugs are as close to a miracle drug that we have ever seen pe is more than half what it is for lly ozempic is the most well known weight loss drug people say theyre on ozempic even when theyre using a competitor  theyve managed to completely give up their gains for the year my intuition says theyre a buy at 102 but my understanding of biotech is their valuation depends a lot on what comes out of their drug trials havent they had some troubles outside of ozempic lately  it will be fine as they probably got a large number of new subscribers plus advertising dollars    yes some of new subscribers will bale but with nfl on christmas day event  some will hold on to for the quarter  thats what i was thinking absolutely terrible work from netflix ive had to resort to watching someone whos in the arena live streaming the fight from their seat because netflix crashed  the guy is assembling a cabinet that looks like the avengers of corruption and grifting  this is actually a brilliant strategy by the republicans the rich get rich while messing up the country democrats then have to spend all of their efforts restoring the country to normalcy and have no time to actually implement any significant democratic agenda republicans then complain democrats accomplished nothing and get elected again  whats incredibly scary to me is that we just had an administration prove that you dont need to enact austere recessionary measures to maintain a healthy economy and improve inflation 

the fact that the electorate voted them down encourages future administrations to favor recession over inflation because inflation seems to be a death knell for administrations  bessent seems like about what id expect out of a treasury pick its everyone else hes putting in im concerned about  gets tired of grwoth

dude i hate trump as much as the next person but the us was only growing because of insane reckless government spending if it takes a 6 gdp defecit or whatever it is for 3 gdp growth that just means debt to gdp keeps growing and that cannot happen in perpetuity

the only way out of this is a big recession or 10 inflation somethings gotta give and the longer it gets kicked down the road the worse the inevitable recessioninflation will be  yup stock market wasnt up at all before covid hit when trump was president  the market does need strong and trusted institutions

i wonder whos entire life goal was to undermine them for decades then

also the entire premise is off why does the market needs strong and trusted institutions it hasnt needed any of that like ever also i dont think becoming europe would bring us investors any sizeable returns  the most likely case is that eoy flows that likely have to happen rescue this market beginning later this month but all bets are off when we turn the page to 2025 


my original instincts were right it seems gonna have to hold on for dear life seemingly like 2021 and it may be a case of holding on for 5 months and itll be show time next year probably a mix of 20182022   trusted institutions

weird way to spell burn it all down  there is a lot of inertia in the federal government and we still have functional pro business courts  is your entire portfolio down as well  yep the stupid is in full force lets nominate a sex predator and a frat bro news guy to be in my cabinet

i am a 2nd amendment loving anti illegal immigration type guy but the next 4 years are going to really suck i think

im down quite a bit over the last few weeks

all news is bad news  big oops  that poor dude got wrecked the one who faded oklo for nearly 1000000 is having a blast though  i bought more 65 divvy on a pharma megagiant jesus  what else you think besides oil good call btw oil always comes back  that gap isnt much no 576 and a bit or which gap do you mean  ive been watching this one fall since 100 it is starting to get tempting maybe ill begin building a position  deleted  whenwhy did you start making suggestions for short term option plays what informs them  its astounding how insane the valuation is on this stock

makes tsla 400 in 2021 look like a fucking bargain by comparison  add karp is slimy and now watching and waiting for him to dump more shares  i had a 100 shares i bought at 20 sold a cc for 60 for next year i also feel its bound to see a correction  deleted  to be frank were getting dangerously close to it being likely the ai cycle ended in the summer after all with time of year leading to it being hidden until 2025 


the semiconductor group should not be this weak and it is a huge warning that it is  id avoid for now semi cycle peaked and were looking for a higher low somewhere  in a bull market better buy high sell higher high performance stock its not a time for gambling catch falling knife you cant tell the price you catch is the bottom yet  so youd prefer to be taxed every year on your index fund dividends at a higher marginal rate and possibly wash sale activity that could screw over taxed advantaged accounts depending on how you manage your portfolio over active trades of individual stocks in your taxable plus risking huge losses on individual stocks yet not being able to replenish your retirement account if you make a bad trade 


i find a taxable brokerage account gives me more control and can be very tax efficient if you manage trades by lot you can sell all of the high losslow gain and long term lots first  unless youre using margin this is the way  moves like this usually last longer than people expect smart thing to do is stay away from it it will probably keep rolling over shorts for a while yet  been doing it since this morning now its not fun  my rule of thumb is dont short in a bull market not worth the risk  timing is the impossible part and any gaurantee of profits is already baked into the option price  i mean i suppose its better for execs to actually care about shareholders making money if you own the stock but seems to confirm that a lot of their valuation is smoke and mirrors at this point i sold 80 of my stake at 60 will sell the other 20 at 70  as if there wasnt enough of a red flag with the ceo making statements like we absolutely eviscerated this quarter and the winners in ai will be powered by palantir and the losers will read analyst notes on the earnings call given how strong our results are i almost feel like we should just go home  healthy pullback is fine  markets went down about 9  you got me curious  go back to it and look at your stocks eod monday  and you didnt invite any of us big dawg smh  maybe for the inidices but lots of stocks are sold off hard with good buy opps  because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29 its fucking insane

people buy overvalued shit like pltr and get rewarded by 60 gains in 8 days this is fucking insane i cant use the real word to describe this since its banned on the sub

this market has gone full simple jack  only the 95th percentile

seems low  repeat after me   i will buy into the stocks i have conviction in when mr market gives me chances instead of posting the same rant comment multiple times a day  why is rklb a meme stock arent they one of the only companies to make it into orbit  remindme 2 months  i bought more tlt this morning  the current yield is around 395  us 20 yr interest rates will get below that rate eventually  the question is when  and since i cant time the market i might as well buy the sure thing which is tlt that will eventually increase in price while collecting a 395 yield until us 1020 yr rates fall below that level  is there a chance it goes to the low 80s again  i sold all my rklb at 15 and regret it now had a 3 average too   i sold all at 15 and regret it now had a 3 average too   if you want ai hardware go nvda or go home buy high sell higher i sold all my nvda after it beat amd in price ai stock performance recently isnt good  nice i keep checking back and seeing it hit 171 makes me wish i sold a bit later haha but gains are gains  whod have thought that naming a true imbecile to be sec of health would be perceived as bad for sciencebased health companies  with a 129 rsi at the very least would be surprised if it doesnt bounce soon given how massively technically oversold that is  this and oklo since hes a board member


might see a quick pumpdump this week but longterm might be good bets  super bullish for oklo wright had invested 10m at a very early stage hes sold on smrs and especially their solution along with thiel  wouldnt mind it pulling back til january  you need at least a 30 pullback for healthy valuations  because someone actually bought the pokemon greninja ex 214167 pokemon tcg twilight masquerade special illustration rare card for 32999 yesterday on ebay marking the top of the speculative bubble    the 23 this year isnt good enough  nothing a few million dollars in donations wont solve  i still dont see how his appointment affects lly and nvo in any significant way  ive been buying the dip on pfe   if healthcare is going the way of the dinosaur then i guess its time to sell  

you can clearly see people freaking out over day to day action  as someone who invested in them heavily 20192023 id avoid chip equipment for awhile personally lam research applied materials asml and klac all seem primed to see declining growth and shortening backlog the next year or two due to the massive global fab build out weve seen now getting into operation i also expect china sanctionstariffs to hit them hard foundries tsm intel samsung etc are probably going to be taking a step back from the massive capex orders theyve been putting in to recoup their investments for awhile  probably going to be pain until next year a lot of the chip market for autos and industrials have sucked for the past year 

hopefully will rebound next year but pieces for these companies are actually solid for long term holds   powell said yesterday fed isnt in a rush to reduce rates  december rate cuts went from 83 to 50s powell said economy too strong will have to wait and watch  zoom out  same i topped up amat asml and started a position in lrcx  thats funny  i see meta will face antitrust over instagram and whatsapp acquisitions by us courts when i google facebook    deleted  ill take it til january but then it needs to go up  yes

and a ps of 50

and a peg of 148  hvac and electrification are strong global trends   healthcare and maybe enwrgy  i agree with lance on energy personally i think solar and nuclear more focus on nuclear will be really great investments for the 1020 year time frame the new admin coming in has indicated that solar and nuclear are both focuses  same with my shares of kmi  i am not complaining in 2024 thou oil  gas pipelines stocks have had a nice bullrun this year  how is everyone suddenly talking about onto i hadnt seen that name before and now it appears all the time  buy high sell low  the same as whats happening with the majority of the market if nasdaq is down 22 as it currently is chances are amzn isnt green  rsu vests today bulk sell orders bringing the price down same with meta  yeah i bought most popular genz brand expanding internationally and expanding into rural areas with dollar store  whats the moat w these ultas and elfs  actually it would be dumb if it didnt accrue its not like the money is taking a vacation  should i still drop 2k on it or wait  its november 15  i must be holding the wrong european stocks nvo rog asml and azn are all red  im honestly surprised all the risks from china arent already priced in youd think they would be  its not like the political uncertainty has ever been secret  but i guess the market is still trying to figure it out  i think celh could definitely work from here its just still a big gamble of consumer preferences you are at least 100 smarter than the momo guys who bought at 90  classic redditor moves stock goes down people think its trash and sell it see posts around last google dip stock pumps and people fomo into it until someone finds the top lel  amd is almost there  mpwr although it still looks expensive and their are rumors circulating about their nvda allocation  axcelis technologies is down like 60 but auto semiconductors need to start recovering before theres any decent upside  hiti for me any day of the week  idk mortgage rates have been going up since the fed first started cutting ratesif the 10year keeps going up homebuilders margins will come into question even more  honestly i feel bad for you the writing was on the wall and the short bounce above 3 was one my best stock option exits yet especially now with hindsight regarding the bankruptcy

your options are currently worth 0 some brokers support selling on otc markets not sure about fidelity also you have to check the status of the stock on otc it might be halted due to the bankruptcy for some time i would say there will be 0 liquidity for your options anyways you might have to work with fidelity directly to sell it

but to be frank i am not sure how long dated are the options you are holding but your only way out is if the stars align and someone buys the company along with the debt otherwise you are wiped out rules of the casino  expectations are in the gutter for disney and sky high for megacap tech its that simple  stocks dont move proportionally to fundemetnals changes 

stocks often stay depressed or elevated for long periods then suddenly something changes and the stocks moves alot

sentiment finally changing for disney 

look at sofi as an example  improving fundementals for years stock goes nowhere suddenly one additional quarter of the same thing and the stock pretty much doubles 

why didnt it happen the previous quarters why didnt stock move up slowly as earnings kept beating why did it stay pretty much flat  because it does that  

monday it will be up irrationally as well  powells remarks today indicated the fed may slow down or halt its rate cut schedule this alone would not have triggered a selloff except the import price index came in very hot and business inventories were smaller than anticipated then there were some of trumps picks for cabinet positions  powell said no rate cuts in december and some trump picks scared the market he said he would also remove ai barriers that biden put in and imposed tariffs so the tech sector is selling off more than the general market  borderline crashing  

good  its getting to january to buy oil stocks at the bottom  wym cancer  its a long term buy doesnt matter what price it is just buy  i plan on bulking up in voo next week  where were you just 1 month ago  never hurts to take gains equal to what you bought for  why has pltr been so volatile  at a 150 forward pe i would at least be asking covered calls and making back my purchase price   nice pick financial look perfect too good to be true  but its real  lol  the news hit yesterday not sure why it took wall street 24 hours to notice  yes depending on your time horizon  you are getting downvoted by this sub so yes it will be a x10 bagger lol  nope never sell i got 2025 more years

chip makers are moving towards square wafers and there is a lot of gains happening in the advanced packing market this is more ontos space 

theyve also managed the market really well considering industrial and auto market has been in a downturn 

as far as the dilution goes not too sure but also doesnt seem like a huge concern there is only 49m shares available on the float and yoy they increase the share count by 74  different company than onto  why for individual stocks if your goal is to hold for 510 years  mypillow ceo appointed to head department of anti woke services cant even get a goods nights sleep anymore because woke

michael judge will be siting there launging maniacally  im seeing down 6 ytd where are you seeing 2  it will also be interesting to get to know about their new cagrisema drug results should come out in novemberdecember could definitely come with a reversal in the stock price if results are good  there will be results from their new drug cagrisema either this month or next investors are also nervous about if their acquisition of catalent will go through if it gets blocked it will set novo nordisks ability to ramp up their production back significantly however they do have a plan b whatever that might be  we dont have a longterm healthy economy 

during the last two years of bidens term the government spent 67 of gdp to maintain gdp growth of 225 mind you governments typically spend 253 of gdp during recessions as a countercyclical measure private sector investment and payrolls have been abysmal during that time not to mention go has trailed gdp since 2022 gross output front runs gross domestic product during a recovery  trump added 8tr to debt and only 2 tr to gdp biden added 8tr to debt but 8tr to gdp its a blowout trump performance of 4 to 1 debt to gdp ratio is unsustainable and will collapse the economy   trump added 8tr and next to little gdp biden done a lot better  its a revenue problem  64 percent of gdp on discretionary spending us historically low


httpswwwbrookingseduarticleswhatisdiscretionaryspendinginthefederalbudgettextin2019732c20discretionary20spending20amountedwith20concerns20about20national20security


much of that is spent on the military veterans benefits etc which most people wouldnt consider optional


httpsusafactsorgarticleshowmuchofthefederalbudgetisdiscretionaryspending  it was up then came crashing down when he botched the handling of it by telling people to drink bleach   yes 75 months lf growth from obama  i mean he did inherit economy from obama he didnt add anything other than tax cuts but a sign of a strong stock market  is how it responds to adversity

trump let it crash with covid 

biden actually had to pass things to make this stock market resilient and look despite everything happen look at it now  im about to lose all the gains from him getting elected  we no giant anymore our mc is pathetic still holding tho  ive been pretty critical of leu as not being worth 100 based on fundamentals but its starting to retreat back into sensible territory if it falls below 60 its worth looking into some of the midtier and junior gold miners are getting beaten up due to gold price and the failures of the large caps yet theyre still recording record margins and fcf wdoff gau sand fsm etc are trading cheap atm aem is woefully underpriced compared to its blowout earnings report anet is oversold imo ditto for biotech and health care 

my main recommendation is to run puts on individual stocks the weak ones with strong downward trends are going to get destroyed if the indices continue falling giving you the opportunity to make a lot of money quickly and recycle that cash into the oversold strong ones my portfolio is flat today but im up 3 overall due to fading hsy udeep_cfc did even better  5750 is the 50day ma 5700 is the preelection floor 5400 is the september 6th floor and 5180 is the august bottom given that election fomo broke the rising wedge pattern that wouldve led to a normal correction theres a real chance we break the 50 ema and the preelection floor  none of them have hit their marks yet 

the market open doesnt factor in

ndaq is still fine to enter its a long play with plenty of room to run  when about a month ago

why because shortterm option trades are among the safest and most lucrative ways of making money if they are exploiting the structural makeup of the stock market this is the opposite of gambling on directional plays or using them to hedge a larger portfolio additionally it allows consistent cash flow to recycle into the main portfolio

what informs them the nature of the strategy all of them  i use 3 to 4 right now  rely on piggybacking off the money flow in stocksetfs in different ways 

currently im selling off some holdings to allocate 30 of the portfolio to options it will be a substitute for bonds whose profit factor pales in comparison and returns dont compound  always a massive red flag when the ceo of a public company makes statements like we absolutely eviscerated this quarter and the winners in ai will be powered by palantir and the losers will read analyst notes on the earnings call given how strong our results are i almost feel like we should just go home  what expiration  like instagram and whatsapp what are more popular alternatives to those  correct 

smh has not come close to recapturing its july high despite the market attaining several new aths its failed to decisively break 260 resistance twice during that timespan and now its rolling over semis were in the red even during the postelection hype rally  depends on the semi exposure the only line of business for the past year or so that has been good was the advanced computeai stuff 

if you follow the market auto and industrial names that are more of the dumb chips have not found a bottom and have been seeing sales slump for a while  shorting is the ultimate fomo game i dont think ive ever made money buying puts but im always right about overpriced companies in the long term   word  agree lots under the surface thats plenty cheap  please name a few good blue chip stocks that have fallen pretty good i see amazon which i can buy i have some cash sitting on the sidelines  this is trumps economy now so the only companies that will do good in the future have a direct hand in his corruption that is why tsla and pltr are up its because they will directly benefit from this corruption  i remember 99 i was there i lost 30k in the dot com bubble bursting 20002001 basically

this is not the same as that because for every applovin or palantir that we have right now we had 30 more in 1999 its only a few stocks here and there that are going nuclear

if things were really as amazing as people make it out to be my portfolio would be sky high and it isnt

unfortunately i dont have a palantir or applovin in my lineup my only stock thats pumped recently has been palo alto but its pump was incredibly mild compared to some of the highflyers i have a bunch of stocks that have gone nowhere recently google broadcom and amd are three great examples all wallowing in the mud for various reasons broadcom is up if you zoom out but i only bought it earlier this year i didnt get it in 2023 wish i did

basically the point im trying to make is that in 1999 the equivalent of google amd and broadcom would all be going absolutely sky high everything was topping it wasnt just the hardcore internet plays with high potential and zero realworld profits that were going absolutely nuclear even the regular stocks were going wild we dont have that right now is apple 245 right now is microsoft 500 right now   because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29 

based on what  im just saying the obvious mate and im not complaining about any stock stock falling specifically rn  because it doesnt trade on fundamentals and has a cult following its not a bad company per se i myself own some shares but its just trading on vibes with ps of 28 higher than that of spacex  i will be messaging you in 2 months on 20250115 164421 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202501152016442120utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1grtfyqrstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_novlxaelx7context3

  over what time span eventually yields will retreat in the shortterm but i believe were in a secular upwards trend  you mean rklb
its the best space stock imo  have revenue revenue keep growing the least volatile compare to gsat asts lunr  i wanted to be greedy but once it hit 17150 i figured it was best to take the money and run 

for someone who just started options trading you hit the jackpot on this one dont feel any regrets about not trying to maximize down to the dollar  well have to wait and see wont have the tfsa room for it until january anyways but ill keep an eye out  didnt think about a pump  dump because of this damn good looking out  does he have experience in small scale nuclear or has he said something about it i just know his background is in part in fossil fuels and possibly some selfdelivering mechanisms whatever they are  theyve doomed us all  ive meant the pe ratio being so low lmao just because it has went up doesnt mean its not undervalued af  i am looking into lrcx and klac already have some amat and asml  down some though once we commit to holding long term and factor in the demand for powercost efficient chip and the associated complexity it should work out great  yeah im excited to see what the earnings look like once the dumb chips inevitably rebounds

if that rebounds and ai chip demand stays strong earnings could be insane the next few years  thats bullish cuz it means economy isnt fooking exploding  no interest in cdns and klac  that one has been eclipsed by the eu one  they cant control them so all they can do is extort them 

no difference than paying the mob protection money  karp is god your name opinion is invalid pltr to 500share  something like 70 of britain doesnt have ac and for some weird reason global temps are higher  midstream should enjoy a nice decade ahead so were in a good spot to slowly add to our holdings  there is another user here i always forget their name that had a post around equipment maker names if follow the chip space outside of advance computer there has been a ton of weakness in auto and industrial markets 

a lot of these names have come down in price and are looking like solid longs but there is still going to be pain until those markets recover 

with onto in particular they did just report earnings on the 31st and i recently got into them after learning more about them 

i know a lot of people are kind of hit or miss with youtube but i would highly suggest watching the video from chip stock investor on onto we cant post youtube links here but they are hands down one of the best ways to learn about a lot of these companies they are trying to sell you on their discordnews letter but overall still gives you great content from the videos  not going to lie i had only been eyeing amat but i saw onto in this thread looked at its stats and like it at a glance it seems like its on sale in today im part of the reddit repeat problem have no position but its on my radar from this subreddit  thanks interesting to know  great to know solid growth story  no idea about ulta moat but they must have something   look at those margins elf is is a marketing machine with high margin beauty product company attached not sure how old you are but it is hard imo for the over 50 crowd to understand  and stomach the way marketing to younger women has to be handled now its clear that both loreal and estee lauder have had a hard time responding the demands of a younger consumer when there was choice the moat is its human capital imo once the street gets a better handle on elfs ability to grow at a lower growth rate the stock will probably regain its upward trend it wont grow like in the past but likely has a ton of runway left over the medium and longer term i have my fingers crossed for a long long long runway of high simgles to low teens growth internally financed but well see  deleted  i will tell you to all in  because i hold a lot of mstr finacial advice  market has been completely ignoring any geopolitical risk for semiconductors  my guess for now is that it wont really start being priced in until we flip the calendar to 2025 and its going to be a huge mess because semiconductors have gotten too far intertwined with the nasdaq compared to even the recent past

gonna have to take down some of my exposure to broadcom pop some popcorn and be ready to pounce when you see smh lose most of its gains from late 2023  buy high sell low the redditor way  if the news is poor the trading opportunities to the downside will be even greater  its interesting how so many people miss that aspect of earnings its not uncommon for people to ask why around them and its usually a few things that impact how people trade earnings which is like how much the stock ran up how was last quarters performance what is the guidance then any macro news like stock buybacks or leadership changes 

plus i want to say you can even look at options to see the implied move to the upside or downside  he said he would also remove ai barriers that biden put in

now we know who to blame the robot uprising on  he would also remove ai barriers that biden put in

how is this bad for the tech sector  deleted  its a stock with an incurable disease of insider selling first bezos now mackenzie rumors say  u think its going down even more next week my plan is to dca weekly to be safe and then eventually lump sum  bro thursday  options expiry is a more probable explanation than anything   id add that u should buy the one with the lowest expense fee  i like the thesis but who are ontos main clients i want to know if theyre mainly selling to tsmc or companies like intel  you are correct i also believe the op holds on  because companies trajectories can always change  because mrna is down almost 90 from its pandemic peak 37 today  you think it will ever reach 450 again  a lot of individual stocks either stay flat or go negative just check out the stocks in the sp500 you need to time it to do well look at msft is it extremely flat this year great company  sylvester stallone trying his best for dept of education calling trump the 2nd george washington  the fact is that the unemployment rate is low consumer spending is still resilient inflation is calming down and growth is still good

could be a lot worse recession  biden didnt add 8 trillion to gdp the economy was coming out of covid so naturally gdp would skyrocket back up but biden torched gross output in the process  thats far more important than gdp  which is why so many sectors are in malaise  yes its a lot easier to add gdp when trillions of money gets printed  oh the good old if the economy does well during a republicans term its because of the predecessor argument 

but if the economy does well during a democrats term its because of them right couldnt be because of bush that obama did well right  let it crash as in he could have prevented crashing yet the economy literally crashed in every other country as well

tons of reasons to not like trump but acting like hes responsible for the covid economy crash lmao would have crashed regardless of which political party was in power  yeah im seeing a huge dip i ate losses on el earlier this month i think im just going to ride these out for a while  probably not alone


im going to credit cosmicspiral here theres clearly no interest in markets right now 


i was right that the vol unwind was going to push markets higher but there was no substance behind it outside the vol unwind


eoy flows may help us hold on for dear life but i think we may be screwed next year  oh no back to values last seen since monday 

did you just start investing last week or something  yeah but there a lot good turnaround stories for legacy industry stalwarts that lost their direction 

look at ge 3m  deleted  would you explain how you can read the steal make up of the stocker market and how to read the money flows  karp is always like that hes a weird one lol  can say the same to micheal saylor elon musk
thats how those smart guys do marketing to their stock
they build themselves a character on social media they act edgy they want you to hate them so they can be noticed  they are more popular  their business get more popular to the public

technology good enough fundamental good enough you just need someone to marketing the good to the public

casual investor just need somewhere safe to put their hardearned money in  0925  people started using signal and telegram a lot more in my groups messenger is literally dead in my group few years ago everyone was on messenger  assuming reels is an entity that hasnt split from fbinsta id say tiktok is far more popular with younger people meta platforms have a larger existing user base

there are countless alternative for messaging apps  letter  clown market valuations meme stocks going up on nothing pltr at a ps ratio over 50 tsla at a pe of 88 the top 10 sp 500 components have an average pe over 50 us large cap stocks have seen lots of multiple expansion even though interest rates are meaningfully higher now than they were several years ago  seriously  bro you just complained about googl yesterday and today  spacex isnt listed for trading though almost everyone who holds rklb shares would buy spacex if they could  if us treasuries or any major developed worlds government bonds are in a secular upward trend than the world economy is screwed  we live in a debt based world where growth can only be shown by increasing the money supply  

i do believe us interest rates will be higher than the last 20 years but if we get above 67 than everything crashes  including gold btw  we will see 23 1020 yr us interest rates by the end of 2025  yea i agree lots of positives in recent call too hoping for a drop but i dont think well see a drastic one for a while  it pumped and dumped last week before the board member appointment news came out its still on sale  pe of 23 isnt that low spy average is 16 its almost 50 higher what more do you want  nah the market for whatever logicalillogical reason wants cuts jpow being hawkish isnt what the market wants  signed karps mom  we would use it about 5 days a year in the uk the mean daily maximum is 22⁰c 71⁰f  the average high temp for london in july is around 75 degrees f its not really that hot of a country london is significantly further north than even montreal

i still think its a trend but the uk probably isnt the biggest growth market for hvac  its pretty wild 

feels like a lot of degrowth mentally at least in the us air conditioning is the reason why the southwest is even livable 

hvac itself its a pretty strong growth market 

httpsbuildopscomresourcesvalueofhvacmarketinusaforpast10yearschart  its more about mainland europe france italy spain etc are all getting more extreme weather  i do listen to them some times but i dont find them to be fair have never heard them say they made a bad decision all their videos start with how they bought something and either hit it big and buying more or selling to take profits thanks for the tip though i appreciate it  thanks mate i am like you too just alarmed how that name is so prominent now for being such a small player  thats not a moat  haha i dropped a bag   its not uncommon for people to ask why around them and its usually a few things that impact how people trade earnings which is like how much the stock ran up how was last quarters performance what is the guidance then any macro news like stock buybacks or leadership changes

exactly how many times this earnings season have we seen a company beat expectations but get sold off on lowered guidance for q4 and q1 fy25

 plus i want to say you can even look at options to see the implied move to the upside or downside

yup check the premiums at the strike price and the clusters where bets are being concentrated for the probability distribution of the implied move there are slightly more complex calculations  bc dont you want america to be world leaders in ai by removing the barriers its open game for the world 

its like america is trying to have a patent on ai tech before the world finds out but now trump wants to remove that patent

ai is the primary surge for the tech sector which has carried the market  yes trump plans to add tariffs to gpu imports announced today  lolno one known my manespecially not a random redditor  yeah i understand that but how do you exactly time it you could buy 50 share of a really good company at 100bucks a share and then it goes down to 70 bucks a week later whats the best way to go about it i usually do an etf but im spending a bit more on individual stocks like amazon microsoft nvidia  the country wasnt coming out of covid ya big goof more people died of covid in 2021 than they did in 2020  bush

let the adults talk  gfc then covid not much to merit taking credit like that the past 20 years clinton obama and biden have all passed off well performing economies  bush had recessions bro lol  i mean every other country isnt improving from inflation like us right now what does that say 

had trump let powell do his thing back then instead of threatening him yea it wouldnt crash as bad  theres certainly interest in markets and you were correct the volatility crush led to stocks soaring after the election the problem was that the weak fundamentals from august remained without the election euphoria we probably wouldve entered a normal correction period after october now we have a gapfill scenario to entertain  the 8day emas for novartis and tandem are 10466 and 3007 respectively novartis is resting directly on top of the lower avwap line  you use different tools for each one as theyre riding different patterns of buying and selling theres no general theory beyond the fact that most of the buying and selling is done by institutions  no in europe literally everyone uses whatsapp as the main form of messaging just like imessage here nobody texts in an alternative way whastapp and instagram are far from being replaced in the next decade facebook is losing users but it depends on the function marketplace and groups will still have their place 

i dont know about telegram in europe it is used if you are messaging about sketchy stuff 

anyways i am not on meta as a stock but i think the price is rational  envelope  can you please chill  yes there are some clown market valuations going on but its not as extensive as youre making it out to be

i really wish it was as extensive as youre making it out to be then id be able to retire but alas not every stock is an applovin or a palantir

google has a forward pe of 1984

meta has a forward pe of 2283

heck even somebody like amd has a forward pe of 2786

does that sound like clown world to you

if this market was truly the bubble of all bubbles then surely all of those pes would be way the f higher  sure its not listed but valuations are out there recent one is at about 250b usd you can also buy shares of spacex at the secondary markets  google owns roughly 10 of spacex btw the shares are really tough to get though with that valuation though itd roughly trade at 20 ps which means rklb is trading at 40 premium at the spacex if it was a public company without being profitable and without having the starlink  apple valuation would be justified for a compounder like google is unlike apple its actually growing quite fast actually  last time he cut the real rates went up bigly  carr is becoming pretty intriguing on this dip to me  fair point yeah im less concerned around they are buying compared to the information they supply for the company thats why i called out upfront since i do believe that most youtubers are trying to sale you on their product or newsletter

one of the few great ones is plain bagel but hes more just general knowledge around the market but i do like the background and info chip stock investors supply about the companies  mother of all trends  i wonder what trumps logic is behind that decision  wait till a certain price to buy it instead of dumping in money randomly every 2 weeks at whatever the prices are  yet despite that gdp clearly recovered from its sharp nadir in q2 2020httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriesgdp recovering all its losses and then some  more people died of covid in 2021 than they did in 2020

you are mixing different things up its not about how many people diedmost with 4comorbidities and past life expectancy but about lockdowns and supply shocks

not sure why are you being so disingenuous  bush didnt come before obama

lets get you back to bed grandpa  the economy was doing great before covid hit if a new covid hit six months ago and the economy tanked youd say biden didnt do a good job with the economy

like youre smarter than this cmon  had trump let powell do his thing buddy the country literally stopped full force it was gonna crash no matter what powell did or didnt do

and then there was a bipartisan bill that pumped money into the economy way too far leading to inflation bipartisan

i think biden has done a good job with the economy but yeah the economy was doing well under trump until covid hit thats just a fact  deleted  google and meta arent necessarily as cheap as you think firstly forward earnings estimates are unreliable secondly its more important to look at fcf  sbc those multiples are significantly higher  you cant easily buy spacex shares without either knowing someone who owns them or having a few million dollars to invest 

are you willing to sell me spacex shares i will gladly pay you a 40 premium for them  i think this is one of those zoom out situations look at net income 5 year performance etc 

also note that apple is a wallstreet darling 

rather than thinking a big tech company with a 45 higher than average pe should have an even higher pe you should be thinking that overvalued companies like apple tesla pltr etc deserve lower pes these are the highest valuations weve seen in decades not sure why youd want the bubble to be blown up even more  agree i also listen to build invest live but matt derron not too many stock pitches but he has good insights abt what he holds and how he analyzes them  trump logic  so biden inherited the same pandemic as trump did but quadrupled his economic performance with 4 times the gdp growth  i do blame trump for how he politicized covid response and made it much less effective but i dont put much blame on him for the economic effects of covid same way i dont directly blame biden for the inflation during his term the average voter though blames trump for the covid economy and biden for inflationthe k shaped economy were seeing  i was referring to prior to covid trump threatened powell to decrease rates or get fired  ive added novartis but currently im looking into another play based on gamma exposure but yes all of them except for tandem are in play

boeing is also entering the put zone  amazon currently is trading at its cheapest trailing pe of the year  biden inherited a pandemic that was already starting to abate while trumps last year was when covid 19 reached the us how was trump supposed to recover from a pandemic that began at the end of his first term

stop letting politics rot your brain and use common sense  well im glad we both arent the average voter i dont blame trump for the covid economy and i dont blame biden for inflation  prior to covid stocks were at an all time high  deleted  deleted  they both spent too much our economy is a house of cards  it wasnt starting to abate more people died of covid in 2021 than they did in 2020  hooray us were in a shrinking minority at this point  removed  its about institutional investors selling at targeted levels where they can scrape profit off on their holdings since these are automated by algorithmic accumulationreduction this is lucrative and easy to spot if you have time to scan through all the liquid tickers thats very tedious unless you have a scanner dedicated to evaluating individual stock momentum

december 6th 145 strike wait until it closes below the 8day ema  for boeing  what about 2022 and 2023 also the death count has nothing to do with gdp  not to mention how it disproportionately affected minorities and trans communities lets be real  deleted  for this boeing play its under the 8 day ema rn is there a difference when you say wait till it closes below the 8 day ema like it has to be under the ema at market close also what price are you trying to sell at",0.973,1.0,1

holy shit

rddt and nvidia would make up like 90 of my down payment  in 2021 the reason behind high valuation was the low rates in 2024 the 10y is at 44 and the multiples are even higher it never made sense to me  one day after google sells chrome they gonna launch google internet browser 2  man cost dipped once two years ago and never looked back  that august yen panic still the funniest shit that happened this year  goog shitting the bed hard 

it always seems to be hit the hardest on red days the softest on green days with positive ers that dont make all too much movement relative to others  so is the message to keep buying nvda and crypto idk why more people arent getting 2021 vibes yet  sold my final remaining shares of ui for a 200 gain average gain on my lots was 110 though at this point i cant bank on multiple expansion anymore nor do i have any compelling insight on earnings growth ahead to justify holding on

looking to buy more googamzn perhaps  woah nvda just filled the gap  initial jobless claims below expectations  
213k vs 220k consensus vs 219k prior  
  
continuing claims well above expectations and highest since nov 2021  
1908k vs 1870k consensus vs 1872k prior  
  
nov philly fed manufacturing much weaker than expected  
55 vs 8 consensus vs 103 in oct  a few days ago my portfolio was in the red and i regrettably accused the suits of manipulating my portfolio personally and then triggering a v shape the next day in the positions i sold out today my portfolio is well in the green i now see the error in my ways i was wrong to accuse them of screwing over retail it turns out i was just a brilliant investor all along and just had to be patient in order to reap the reward i told my family about the gains and now they all want me to invest on their behalf i look forward to seeing their faces as i double the savings they entrusted to me with a new position in ionq a company on the cutting edge of quantum computing they are closely tied with the university of maryland who have a really good physics program the stock is already up 169 as the smart investors like me see that quantum computing will completely flip the tables on traditional cpugpu based hardware 

just to do some basic calculations the tam of quantum computing is going to be about 1t by 2035 ionq as the market leader will probably take at least 40 of this so call it 400b in sales assume they have gross margins rivaling nvda say 70 thats 280b in annual earnings by 2035 currently ionq does 52m in profit as they inflect toward profitability assuming they get halfway there by 2030 or 140b in net income they have 211m shares outstanding but assume this quadruples for their massive capital expansion that gets you to 165 in eps by 2030 apply a conservative 8x multiple on this and you get a stock price of 1320 in 5 years thats roughly a 208 cagr incredible how a back of the envelope calculation can extract such obvious stock theses  damn so google is tanking on news we all knew for at least two days now goes to show you the market does what it wants why tank two days later idk  the hidden snow holders are out today but theyre always missing after a bad quarter  googl responding to headlines claiming chrome selloff i dont think a final decision has been reached yet its just what doj is pushing for prosecutors always over ask its just good tactics who would even be a potential buyer who could afford to buy something that valuable  mstr will be a glorious story of a dotcom bubble 20 its happening right before our eyes  caap 7 on earnings might consider opening a position already in omab but caap is argentina exposure which i lack other than meli  might sprinkle a few bucks into mstz soon dont care if i lose it all but im doubtful of the infinite money glitch mstr is trying to do  sold out of rcat for a 50 gain fun times also that swing trade suggestion from yesterday on powl was  sold for a quick 2k gain  mstr getting clobbered  mstr lol  god bless whoever had the balls to short mstr today  rddt down about 6 in afterhours   google buying opportunity  poor goog

insane numbers not sure i have ever seen a management team go so ham on buybacks still has done nothing for them yet though but chitchatmoney did a good episode on some of the best uses of buybacks are when the market does not move the stock and management has the chance to buy an insane  of the float  toying with loading mpwr blackwell ahead of schedule on deliveries rumor about nvda deal dropped mpwr by  40 at this point not super cheap but fine for the growth if it holds  damn googl  december hwm calls have finally turned positive nice  im thinking about buying bn the more i read the more i see that they literally just have their hand in everything and management is really strong

anyone else hold  se just hit 200 gain on 1y holding strong to this the chart is looking fantastic  swapped out my grab for some onto and mpwr retipped up my google trying to hold it steady at 10ish of my portfolio as it drops my sold nbis 1750p dec now at 50 profit for me so starting to think about closing soon  why is rddt so up today  the m2 supply chart is hilarious all those rate hikes barely made a dent  just bought the google dip sorry boys its going lower now  what was the new info on goog the chrome thing was like 2 days ago no  well natural gas blew up yesterday and i was watching for it to hit resistance in a bit at 340  

it did but right now 

nice to see my laggards pump its about time  i guess amazon is about to go back below 200 it was fun while it lasted  rcat

after a 30 day yesterday we are pumping an additional 11 today im holding for now but will probably just take all my gains today a win is a win

i also sold nvda at 290 pre split so i may not have the best advice  nordstrom buyout presents a nice opportunity for leaps

the market is extremely fragmented today almost all the downside is coming from tech and communication services but half of all equity sectors are up over 050 growth is getting hammered  wow i had a limit order for blkb at 77 and it somehow went through yesterday evening at 7668 even though the price was at 82 now the stock is at 85 lol  thoughts on soun

ive got some shares in there and thinking to add more or just sell what are your opinions  my november knife catches are mostly working net was best at 17 since the 8th simo 6 since the 13th mdny 8 since the 19th  baba gave back the entire fake ponzi china trade

time to buy the dip again

inline across the board looks like feel like market might be disappointed especially with the strength of the run up as of late but we will see at the open  elf strongly refuted muddy waters short thesis relevant quote from their press release

in particular in early 2024 for competitive reasons and as permitted by applicable regulations we filed a request for confidentiality with us customs and border protection with respect to our customs import data therefore import data available to the public after february 6 2024 does not include a substantial majority of our actual us imports

further muddy waters assertions do not align with the strong consumption data published by nielsen and circana

im satisfied by this staying long and i think this is a great entry point tbh the only thing that worries me now is potential china tariffs but they said they have a gameplan around it  i bought some of the mag 7 stocks near the top im getting beaten up pretty hard with all the anti trust lawsuits hitting somebody give me hope  value stocks doing well today boomers back on top  so when is this market going to drop  going through nvda er and transcript

ai demand will be here for several years as long as trump doesnt say anything dumb and us keeps protecting taiwan tsm is such a great longterm play imo should be 2nd most valuable company after nvda  had a few thousand in my stock account stared at snow for 10 mins yesterday and didnt pull the trigger

taking that l today  there it is  rddt up 4 in premarket   rddt gifemotefree_emotes_packfacepalm  new 52 week high for deere  co de earning this morning werent that great but they beat estimates 

deere eps of 455 down from 826 yoy beating the consensus of 390

stocks up over 5  im looking at zillow  this is a masterclass in irhttpsiimgurcomqh7tdwkjpeg from atkr sourced from twitter perfect for when youre a cyclical getting your eps cut in half  im now up 35 on wbd that was probably the most hatednegative sentiment i bought into since i bought pltr at 7

i dont think wbd will go up 800 in 2 years like pltr did but it is nice to be up 35 on it and see the sentiment shift after the nba three company deal happened  this rddt run is generational and might pay for my next car lmao  with such a big jump with snow is a regression inevitable  ntap earnings looking decent hoping the market agrees and i get two for two for my preearnings gambles this week  googleeee head back to 150 and my money is yours  thats thats a lot of red  snow cooking shorts this morning  new ceo proves his worth with excellent integration of new ai offerings into top shelf analytics  as an aside im very excited to see widespread ai application in the mining sector although we might not consider it a hightech business it requires processing vast quantities of data to plan and optimize operations over a mines lifetime the long lead time before opening a mine is primarily due to this need to nail down all the relevant factors during exploration and feasibility  why is sofi going up so high recently  today feels like the big boys are ready to dump it hard tomorrow

not sure why i get that feeling might just be my bearish bias  crox through 100 is nice my value names are doing okay today plus some saas like mndynet  v  axp have been better performing parts of my portfolio this past couple of months what do we think on their outlook with the potential for them to cap credit card rates as stupid as that would be  any concern here about nvdas gross margin slight decrease this quarter and they expect it to decrease again next quarter still over 70 gross margin which is insane but they need perfection to justify the stock price they said it should come back up to mid 70s h2 2025 but it depends on blackwell rollout  v recovery because god forbid stocks go down  whats been going on with nestle  was expecting nvdia to be red so i can buy but damn  does anybody know about cerence crnc some automotive ai company that just spiked 40 today  after pumping uber for months brad gerstner went on cnbc and said uber is cheap but he is selling position for tsla

maybe every one is right uber will be out of business when autonomous vehicles become more widespread i wont attempt to do a reverse wall street or reverse reddit on the uber negative sentiment  do u guys think vsat is gonna keep going up  removed  first time getting into stocks only put 500 in for now because im not really sure what im doing is this a good spread

stock spreadhttpsimgurcomaiucg693  i did a reverse market by buying adobe and thermo fisher when their price dip 10 or more hope i am not wrong not too optimistic about the trending companies at the moment  just verifying but is it true that i can only see director level or similar employee stock purchases of their company due to the insider trading policy   like if a warehouse associate who packs boxes at a company decided he really thinks its a good company and he buys 45k in shares i wouldnt be able to find out right  seeing the interview with disney cruises showing off their new mega yacht launching in december  the surprising fact is they have 5 total cruise ships today but will have 13 by 2032 just 78 years away

these cruises are money machines expanding capacity that much could be powerful  oklo 16

surely this market isnt euphoric  i would be happy if the government began breaking up the big biys theres no reason for amazon to sell both aws services and toilet paper  wtf nvdia going crazy  advanced auto parts down to lows last seen around 2009 pe still of 52 which seems high for a retailer with not a whole lot of moat and slowing growth i also read they are closing all the stores on the west coast with some closing in louisiana and south carolina also puts  there is just no way this v thing can ever be defeated its like the red candles fuel this thign higher and higher this will never be able to have a real drop again maybe an odd day like last friday but will be impossible to stay down  rddt is going to be worth 100 billion 

rddt hasnt fully monetized yet and still growing rddt was such a buy this year i think they keep growing  is it allowed to post x links here  i fully approve of this market  why is google shitting today  any news i missed  theres no images allowed on here but i have a picture of my 10 worst performers id like to share for those who are interested i just dont know where to do it all of them are in the green at least slightly all dcad at random times since oct 25 last year  thinking about buying google stock but is it worth it with just 500 dollars  starting to get ugly out there  whats wrong w amzn doj gonna break them up too  i dont wanna hear any more crying about mstr if yall dont buy it here  here comes the v yet again never a chance of actually dropping back to new highs clown market will just v every single drop  dxy breaking out  nvda filing looks suspect as hell something weird is going on there with the ballooning accounts receivable major red flag

this is the same shit people were pointing out with enron  that spy premarket pump is crazy 1 in few hours wonder if it hold  whats stopping me from selling a stock that i know for sure will rise so that i can ensure a certain amount of profit  like sell the stock and buy it again immediately  im laughing at google bagholders how come you guys always say that the biggest trash is undervalued you guys were shilling disney intel paypal dking square and all of it is down bigly only pltr came on top now google got kiss of death from reddit even monkey would do better with investing than whats upvoted here makes me think that the stocks that funds want to dump are upvoted by funds bots because its almost impossible that bad investment advices are so highly upvoted each time and also the stocks that had huge run were fudded here like rddt tesla meta hood you guys are amazing  in the event we do see an ugly semiconductor unwind next year which continues to look likely with this type of ugly price action google is very much going to be a key nasdaq laggard along with them probably into july

hope that helps  oh if it wasnt clear its over over for the next 12ish months for semiconductors today is really rubbing salt in those wounds

id have much rather nvda gapped lower the gap up then tank type move is continued trash price action by all semiconductors

the interesting thing is that the ai proxies that arent a semiconductor arent following  who uses google  i havent googled anything in ages  

true its more than a search engine but with ai it is a preposterous search engine looking through ads to find something that is the truth  

thats why ive never owned the thing at its current valuation  happy for you  i hope to be there one day  what are you waiting for to sell i own my house but if i didnt i would get outno one knows whats ahead all we know is you have a down payment  does anyone know why they went up 15  uh have you heard of ai

ai ai ai ai ai  just buy stuff with fair multiples only then thats what i did then that is what i am doing now if the market tanks your stuff should hold up better than the overpriced stuff and if your wrong and the rally continues you make money as the gap closes or your companies do well  crypto bubble and ai bubble will make the whole market dump by 50 the question is when berkshire timed it almost perfectly going all in cash theyll make out like bandits  just wait when the rates drop again  yeah an amazing buying opportunity that guy who loves t was absolutely salivating over it claiming its going to bring the whole market crashing down for ages  your comment makes me panic  because its ceo hates profits and allows staff to roleplay activist politicians maybe resulting in major doj lawsuit because they forgot to hedge against trump victory  reddit stocks peeps get emotional about their stocks  i wouldnt use this place to make investment decisions  ive been buying tlt under 91  the employment numbers weret as good as the headlines stated  

the headline was that jobless claim applications fell by 6000 to 213000 for the week of nov 16 thats fewer than the 220000 analysts forecast

however the continuing claims the total number of americans collecting jobless benefits rose by 36000 to 191 million for the week of nov 9 that was higher than expected and the most in three years  you forgot to factor in capital raises i dont have the patience to write it all out but it turns out we can expect at most a 156 cagr over 5 years worst case still decent but meh if you consider how well mstr will be doing

took a small position 45 of portfolio today  theres no way in hell they will make 400b in sales are you having a laugh for reference costco makes around 250b in revenue quantum computing is a joke 

so far the company loses more money with each passing year and the share count keeps increasing total shitco and a great short  that wasnt back of the envelope that was more like something written on the walls of a crack den  dang nice find bro wish i saw this chart a couple of months ago  is that the opposite of being priced in  20b was being thrown around at that price it seems pretty dumb because a buyer would likely be another big tech player right  matt gaetz will drop the case  if they push for the trial to occur in december i strongly suspect that the prosecutors win considering that weve gotten this far   bottom is in

time to reenter with max leverage  its a phenomenal short  yup just heard people talking about bitcoin on a flight sold my remaining in the air 98100k is max for a little while i would think 

remindme 1 month  its about 40x fcf some stocks are even higher than thatcoughnvda  assigning a multiple on par with the mexican airports would bump up caap to a 30 stock 

also i like that they are more focused on redeployment of capital into the business than paying out dividends theyre in a decent position to scoop up properties if governments try to sell off some assets to raise cash  7 dividend for omab am i seeing that right  40 in two days idk bro but i agree issuing convertibles while bitcoin rises and your stock goes up to buy even more is not a sustainable idea  congrats on rcat that was a very nice trade  rcat has long term potential i would maintain a position if you can russia is ramping up the war europe is going to need weapons rcat comes highly recommended by the us  momentum swings both ways when something is up like 100 in a month it can go down pretty quick too  whoa  i still dont know what they do guess ill just stay poor  i have coworkers seriously telling others to invest their life savings in it  just another gme now  have you heard why im curious since it had a nice pump today  you know what i never but any individual tech stocks but this is too good a chance to pass up for a swing trade  dont you wish that evil on me ricky bobby  you buy in yet  are they making any headway in the online space with betmgm  still considerable downside risk imo it still has a high valuation and a lot of room to fall even more if any more concerns about growth emerge but they could make a comeback if things play out for them  not really a semi company but start looking actually into cart the other day to open a position the valuation actually isnt too terrible and it looks to have sold off from earnings since guidance was a little light  the government gets what the government wants

plenty of public servants will be buying google today knowing damn well they are not breaking up shit and people will panic

they bitch about the president divesting himself of any investments but it should be mandatory for every federally elected official to be divested of any investment anything  rad long on them wish i bought them earlier  i dont own them but been really happy with my kkr holdings  i bought in last week finally theyre basically canadas berkshire hathaway  investors think fake bots for election are real  the current administration isnt serious about reducing inflation   been cycling in and out of goog and selling ccs on them for like a year now keep getting called away last time at 175 but looking tempting again  guess it was speculation so far and now the doj said theyre really going for it  whats the play here also isnt this not confirmed yet so what would happen in the case there is no buyout  i love it when you can snipe a nice entry with a limit order  i bought 200 shares last week and going to just hold  if nvda has a position it is probably good bet  now up 11 from powl and 7 from fn just buying yesterdays dip great swing trades so far  good job let me know abt the next one hehehe  which is funny because apples walled garden seems like what the doj is trying to break up google over apple has safari their own app store and were controlling green bubble chats for years  meta is up 60 ytd  just checked up 22 after hours 94115  corruption is extremely profitable thats why it exists  redditors should buy tesla instead of google now theyre seething  never sell winner in a bull market unless you found a faster winner nasdaq 100 inclusion  bull market  what can stop app will move like pltr the last quarter  ill continue to hold this one will add on weakness  while i have no knowledge regarding elf i do know for a fact that carson block is a lying manipulative piece of humanlike flotsam  he would issue a short report on his own mothers retirement fund if he thought he could make a buck lying about it  really shouldnt be purchasing individual stocks if you need someone on reddit to give you hope about a holding youve had for 36 months  not your fault got it  

everyone has taken profits and are elsewhere  

hope the view improves i reckon it wont for a while  when you go all in  nvda the general of the generals just reported double beat and raise with strong management comments on demand outpacing supply for the foreseeable future why would the market suddenly drop on that  never  why would it i get that on one hand it looks like it ran massively the past couple of months but on the other hand its at about 9 cagr the past 3 years which is below the 10 and 20 year average  considering that my top positions asml msft arent doing too well i hope not anytime soon  just buy stuff that wont drop  this or next month were already seeing mstr cracking with this ai bubble and mstr i can see many tech going on 50 off firesales  doesnt say anything dumb

oh you sweet summer child  the demand is here but what about the end product  i posted a separate comment but i just went through the transcript as well seems the biggest concern is the decrease in gross margin thoughts on that are their numbers just too good to keep going up and justify further stock appreciation  hindsight is a wonderful yet terrible thing  why  csgp  lol i saw that too atkr had a lot of value investors jumping in 30 ago ignoring what had mooned their eps entirely  this isnt advice but ive sometimes found that if its a good enough spike to post its good enough to sell  perhaps but sentiment was really poor valuation was and is pricey even now but if sentiment turns it could run still  maybe but not necessarily  

whether we even call it a jump depends on the zoom level context  

one could say its more like a regressionbounce from being down so much already so theres no downward regression necessary

ive heard speculation its a short squeeze which hints at certain possibilities  for my pstg sake i hope ntap does well too  stoked for you was thinking of playing their earnings but ended up doing that swing trade with powl and fn yesterday  worlds shittiest blue chip stock strikes again  were up  to me this is a great area of roi for ai thats the thing as someone who is a software engineer people kind of lump ai into one thing right now there is two aspects of it large language models llm and machine learning ml 

i think in general mls seem like much better areas of roi like ml use models and get and interpret data for users you dont really get to interact with the data like a llm but you still get something to take action on the best example is google deepmind which figured out protein folding 

mls will benefit from all the ai spend im still kind of hesitant on the total roi that llms will come to represent at least in the short to mid term i still think of them more of proactivity tools and some areas like customer service and paralegal will probably get hit hardest from them at some point in the future  it ran nicely after its great er last month

and today it broke a double top at 1444 so it can continue to the next leg up around 165 in my opinion  nah it cant without making an instant v will surely hit new ath again  ended up pulling the trigger on cart this morning 

net has had a solid recovery since their earnings as well  axp will be more limited in their loaning as they are a bank and cc company but on the other hand they tend to have more high quality customers

v will be impacted only through lower transaction volumes i dont know if transaction volumes will fall by a lot though you could look at europe where most countries have a 1012 credit card interest cap  the concern w nvda isnt the margin isnt the guidance next q the concern is do these chips have profitable applications in the next 24 years commoditized chatbots do not seem to be that  cfo seemed to suggest it was temporary as they ramp up but it is possible that tsm or someone else could be squeezing them a little i think  not allowed until it is  a poorly run company overly dependent on commodity prices    i opened a small position at about 3 just as an outside ai combined with auto recovery bet earnings released today which is the reason for the bump it was incredibly beaten down a gamble but possible turnaround story  i looked into it at one point the company seems to be poorly run constantly changing out management

im not sure why it spiked theres some interesting property therei was just turned off by management  if uber doesnt control the core technology of avs then theyll always be the low margin junior partner to whoever does waymo has demonstrated that expensive robocars with some remote operation is a viable technology at this point even in a crazy city like sf but is still more expensive than just having a driver if tesla can do what waymo does for cheap then it can win the race  why do people think uber will be out of business  i actually think uber will prosper with autonomous cars  uber can still be the app for people to book rides and uber can buy and operate all of the vehicles without having to pay the drivers  tune for brad gerstner starring in young ackman on cbs thursday nights  your post or comment has been removed due to breaking rstocks rule 2 no spam or self promotion

however not sure how it makes the market more competitive if amazon owns them or not  conglomerates arent the real threat unless their being a conglomerate is negatively affecting competition in a way that isnt simply being better than the competition  i think more its better than meta in my opinion obviously a long way away from the actual patents and tech that zucks has under wraps but the reddit product to me is way better than any single meta product and really to me better than the meta offering combined  should be fine but probably should avoid things that still might break rules like mentioning penny stocks but i havent had any issues posting them in the past

edit if i had included my winners also would it have been better received or are people just not interested in portfolios that arent in the rate my portfolio threads  the amount doesnt matter in terms of if its worth it or not percentage growth is what you should be looking at 500 bucks is not nothing and we all do as much as we can  500 is not a small amount  not going to say anything about google but broadly a dollar that is working for you is a dollar that wasnt working for you previously and while it may take some time to set up an account theres no trade fee at most brokers so in terms of worth it doesnt cost you anything  nothing wrong with it its consolidating  who knows man that stock just cant hold any momentum down 7 in the last 5 days for whatever reason  i hear mrs amazon started a selling spree too  bezos kept selling at the price it was at last week so was hills ex itll keep happening for a while i reckon ill be out of this circle soon  if it reaches its last week price and put it in voo  uh  fraud means more pump ahead bullish  something weird is going on there with the ballooning accounts receivable

do you have numbers and  increases you can compare to enron and historical averages or is this just vibes  i do not think fraud but i have been leery with any company having explosive growth explosive demand and new hires  it would not surprise me if there were accounting irregularities especially around booked vs fulfilled orders  cuh u always hating  what about it is suspect  is a 1 premarket move really a crazy pump  theres no way to know for sure what a stock will do  doesnt really make sense what youre asking  maybe elaborate and be specific

i have done that at certain times for tax planning purposes but its hardly a sure thing  also you need to know about wash sale and other implications  how would this be beneficial in any way you will have taxes one your gains which are often higher on shorter term investments and your money is still locked up even if you didnt have the taxes or commission to pay i cant understand what the benefit of this could be  up 18 ytd

id love to be a google bagholder chilling in the bahamas with my bags  why u hating dkng is doing fine  in the past year googl and sq are both up decently for me also i bought rddt a day after ipo only because i learned on reddit about the ipo dont confuse your experience with reddit as a whole theres been plenty of value plays recommended on reddit you just have to use what you know to make the best sense of it you can i bought nxt on a reddit recommendation too well see how it goes  if you had anything good going for yourself you wouldnt have to come here to laugh at google bagholders  nice mental diarrhea  meds  what are you basing this on that the whole semiconductor industry will do terribly for the next year a large proportion are already incredibly beaten down do you just decide this stuff off the top of your head or is there some reasoning behind it you say these things with such assurance like youre an expert in the space but give very little reason or logic to back it up  there will be one more major pump driven by analyst upgrades for exit liquidity  i had a hypothesis that h2 2024 would be the start of the bear cycle for semis but the latest earnings reports from hyperscalers defeated that they are committed to increase capex spending through 2025 we may not see the end of the bull cycle until 2026  tons of people use google also youtube android google cloud gmail etc etc  i use it exactly as i was before this whole ai frenzy maybe i dont search for super complicated things but i literally have not felt any change in my experience except for getting reddit suggestions up top  some other stuff isnt ready for me to buy a house yet but i might just sell and put them into treasuries for a few months 

i didnt expect this i thought both would increase a lot slower than they actually did  that was my strategy in 2021 but not much luck


banks c horribly underperformed spy


car manufacturing hmc and tmc not so good


oil i got lucky with them i bought them in 2021 anticipating return to normalcy but sold them at the peak of 2022 still underperform spy in the long run


retailers wmt the only one kind to me


steel manufacturing my superstars specially x


intc cleans his tears


chinese stuff thank god i stayed away from baba


i enjoy your comments and if i get some extra time i will look into some of the tickets you post  how can you say berkshire timed it perfectly on an apocalypse that hasnt even happened yet

also your claim that berkshire is all in cash is just not true  unless you can make a bunch of cash vanish youll never dump that much money  its amazing how easily some get shook   quantum computing is a joke 

i watched like 12 youtube videos on it including a classic from veritasium so im fairly confident in my research and dd i recommend checking out the ionq subreddit to see some valuable information from the larger community

you cant use regular old multiple like trailing price  sales i recommend something more modern like price  innovation see cathie wood et al  this is my issue

sell it to some other company so they can monopolize it

whats the fucking point of that the consumer is who benefits from foreverfree google services it is virtually the only big tech firm that has not completely fucked over consumers with bullshit fees  imagine if it was nvda lol  i dont think it matters whos in office the case was opened during trumps first term its been a bipartisan effort  once people outside crypto environment ape into a crypto stock this much then the top is in  how to time it though

somebody is going to ride that thing down with shorts and or puts and its going to be glorious probably wont be me though  i will be messaging you in 1 month on 20241222 024210 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202412222002421020utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1gwd90krstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursdaylycqa85context3

  yea thats about right i think  anything i put into it i expect to lose would definetly not try a yolo  it goes up the stairs and down the elevator  i keep seeing people here talking about it and im only just now finding out it isnt the ticker for mastercard  they sell a busines intelligence tool no one uses  thanks that must be the top signal are you coworkers normies or do they deal with stocks a lot  a bit like dotcom bubble 20  because it had a nice pump today lol  tencent sold 88million worth of shares reported 3 hours ago on investingcom  yea decent start position for me i think i feel comfortable enough to make it a decent sized position over time  distant third still i would say   the government gets what the government wants

microsoft has entered the chat  yeah ive looked at them in the past chart is insane and feel like i missed the boat there doesnt seem cheap anymore

the one thing about bn is that they have so many different businesses that its a bit tough to understand them as a shareholder  remember any time you dont understand something online these days you can always just bring up bots in some way shape or form  would like to know too  maybe they shouldnt have gotten into politics so heavily serves them right lose elections  fuck your stockholders  personally i would recommend july 2025 calls at 22 strike

if it was confirmed there would be no point in an options play as it would be priced in it is an asymmetric play with 6x upside where the theta decay curve allows you to exit early with a small loss  very nice powl looked fine to me suppose it was trigger happy sellers with lots of paper gains  onto mpwr crox and mgm at least thats what i am buying rn  never has it been so easy for retail investors to profit off of corruption  this isnt a casino  because its growth rate is decelerating and it was already priced for perfection  nukes inflation and unemployment its a house of cards  overvaluation tariffs debt looming recession looming global conflict should i continue  haha soo truu  metagoogleapplovin are the best scaled examples of using gpus for better ads everyone wants the sexy chat llm killer use case or something but good old ml models to make systems better is a lot of it still  looking at the earnings reports for the past year theyre showing sustained steady growth despite economic challenges theyre very close to profitability and in the next year i could see it get into the sp 500  looks optically cheap at 6x ttm eps but that becomes 11x the low end of fy guidance which is still pretty cheap not sure what the forward multiple is using midcycle pricing for their industry  if i sold meta when it spiked 35 when i bought it at 110 i would have missed out on a lot of gains  a dull 6 months for pstg hopefully a breakout after earnings  cheers  

looks like those worked out pretty decent for you whyd you decide they were good options for swing trades thought the reactions to earnings were overblown  hell of a lot more green on that big board now for sure  there are many nonglamorous sectors where machine learning is going to dramatically boost efficiency cut costs and shorten timelines everyones focused on tech for the headline breakthroughs but biotech mining oil  gas drilling payment processors etc can enjoy considerable gains without the advent of agi the pattern recognition and data processing abilities alone will be transformative  i have not looked at maplebear since its ipo will have to check again  cart as in instacart what made you interested in them  thats more long term yes but as long as meta amazon etc keep spending then nvda will get their bag  medical and security applications for ai are all but untapped both fields require intelligent search models education is another good field for this and of course coding has used ai for a few years now   the concern is do these chips have profitable applications in the next 24 years

i mock techno hype including the romance of the day with ai

but heres the thing you and i might question it  but you know who has no doubt and is gambling their companies on it  meta amazon microsoft and many others  players who dont take capex spending decisions lightly  players who absolutely have direct knowledge of how their ai investment is or isnt working  and with the data theyre seeing they are fighting like madmen to get every nvidia chip they can

i dont usually appeal to tautology but i cant believe theyd be spending so overwhelmingly and rushing to stake claims so rapidly if they werent seeing real evidence of actual roic already  

i also think of jensen huang who hasnt lied yet and hes touting claims like 5 in savings for every 1 spent  thats miracle mothers milk for corporations  

yes there will no doubt be overshooting  there always is  but it seems like early innings as these players are all absolutely rabid for every last chip and every square foot of ai real estate  talk may be cheap but these companies are spending as much as they have and theyd spend much more if there were more chips to buy  actually msft if pushing their ai agents hard i think job automation is what they are seeking how many call center employees can you replace the provider of the agent would make bank if they took even like half of payroll costs saved let alone whatever price they negotiate and thats just one use case theres so many  there was a dd made by an analyst that it is more likely telsa google etc partner with uber since it would be a way to bring the cost down and maximize utilization 

this seems like something we wont know the answer to for at least 1 year  i think between a choice of tesla google and uber the odd one out is uber in order for uber to do well those two dont control the market and that isnt really a popular thing to say at the moment  okay thanks ill sell them all tomorrow and simplify it  my point is that people are chasing the stocks that are already flying same with the btc surge tsla nvda pltr mstr and many others these valuations are not normal but the market keeps pumping  very true but they cooked the books and may be delisted people are hoping for easy money its up 67 past 5 days  many of those are good stocks but you waited way too long to get in  you dont buy stocks like bti costco ko in hopes of outperforming with those theyre for adding downward protecting to your portfolio  thank you so much i appreciate it   as always compared to what

point of reference matters  thank you ive always had mentality that i need at least 10k to buy stocks like that  its been consolidating for 5 years  uh its crashing  its got cancer like google  i have an mba and focused on operations and accounting i was reading some more knowledgable break it down yesterday cause my cursory glance made me a little confused and apparently i am not the only one

but overstating rev by juicing ar is a common method when overstating things since you can keep ar high until its clear you cant anymore its different every time but it always rhymes  nvda has done this in the past cycles with high ar and the  the payments never come and the stock crashes its almost certainly happening right now as well  damn straight i am im a fundies and valuation guy of course im hating on this market  insanely high accounts receivable high cash flows even with high ar it just smells funky  not in this market  the term bagholder has lost all meaning  i disagree not nice  its price action since july


the industry will be perfectly fine but the stock prices will remain dead for the time being  and i wrote that  obviously it appears that you didnt read it

google serach engine has declined and the outlook is not good  people are banking on their new model to changing it around

thats why its lagged lets look forward  research ebita earnings reports growth rates and it spits it out right in front of you  

whatever google transforms itself into it will and it must  even they know it but they arent talking nor should they  if youre long youre long  im not buying it yet  mid caps are screaming right now  you do whats best for you owning a home isnt guaranteed nowadays 

think about it everyone rents everything subscription based everything you think homes will get cheaper relative to income maybe baring something catastrophic 

being an owner will be rare  yea thats some rough times in there for sure and only in hindsight is great value easy to see in terms of good value mgm crox simo xfab infineon and evvty all fit the bill imo  this is why cheap stocks are cheap instead of jpm you got c instead of nvda you got intc instead of life changing gains you got soul crushing underperformance  they can easily dump that much money spreading it into mag7 since there are other decisive people outside warren then i doubt it was the last time that berkshire owns one of the mag7 theyll buy again some of these giants when the time is right  haha missed the obvious sarcasm  sir this is rstocks there is no room for humour here  thats like a phd in quantum comp  disagree considering that trump has suggested that hed let the case die


i suspect they push strongly for a decision next month considering what ive seen  remarkable that bidens doj didnt kill the lawsuit considering google did some heavy duty shilling for dems they truly are the circular firing squad lol

but im not too amused because i do own some goog stock  with companies like this its elevators up and down like something going up 100 in a month isnt really sustainable not saying the gains wont always last but ive seen enough names sell off a lot those gains in a short period too  man it has been so bad lately definitely normies that never used to talk about investing i hear bitcoin mstr and tesla mentioned daily now i had an older gentleman the other day proclaim he was going to be changing his investment strategy soon to day trading a coworker next to me spent half the shift watching youtube videos on which shit coin to invest in next  well 10 bucks is more than just profits taking  thats great news because that feels like something that leads to only a very temporary dip  lol perhaps you didnt look past that first sentence

there are plenty of public servants out there today buying up shares because they know that they arent breaking up shit

the government exists to serve itself and i would love to see the number of congressmen and senators buying up social media stocks today

this isnt even a partisan issue democrats and republicans use their position within the government to enrich themselves

that will never change and this means nothing in the long term

that all being said its far more enjoyable being a shareholder on green days as opposed to red  a big chunk of owning brookfield is trusting bruce flatt to keep running it as he has 

sort of like buying berkshire you dont need to understand everything just trust in warren buffett  yeah just assumed they might be private equity which is like krr part of why kkr exploded is they bought an annuity business the key to that is that it supplies with a lot of cash which they can then go buy more companies 

yeah these type of companies could be really hard to understand what is happening under the hood since there is so many different business and what not  i get the feeling of being skeptical but what happened on reddit on election month is beyond scrutiny call it bots or shills or alt accounts or whatever you want  is there anything you are waiting for her in terms of indicators or have you already entered your position  wasnt expecting it bounce back so quickly but the sell off felt way over done plus it broke the general trend of how the stock has traded at least from following figured it was set up for some recovery wasnt expecting it as quickly as like 1 day 

i mean even atkr announced this morning and went from being down like 9 to up being up 35 now thats like a 13 gain if you bought this morning which is wild crazy to see some of the reversals in some names  whats your thesis for mpwr over the other lagging semis  growth rate deaccelerating as it gets bigger and comes into harder comps was expected hence the guidance raise being a raise not a cut priced for perfection is debatable here  growth rate slowing down for big companies means their competitors have time to catch up  inflation is down unemployment is still low and if nukes launch money is the least of our problems  looming global conflict unlike the last few years with total peace oh wait a minute  whos to say its overvalued  
  
we dont have many tariffs currently and we dont know what the extent of the tariffs will be  
  
we are always on the verge of a debt crisis  
  
what looming recession the economy is growing and has remained resilient  looking at finchat precovid it was about 8fwd although it cycled between like 513 as a range for forwards  totally agree  my discipline is to almost always lock in large rapid gains  some times when i havent that peak is gone for years or forever  

in this specific case i considered that its wbd which i have less confidence in than facebook which like you i didnt sell back then either  yea bought a little more recently valuation is not as forgiving as it was a while back here though so need some nice numbers to move  im long both companies so i follow them and earnings 

powl basically for the past year pops on earnings and then trades flat or down until the next report this time it was trading up going into earnings and the reaction to the numbers were over blown 

also this past quarter ive seen a lot of names drop down and come back with really quick reversals throughout the day like lscc they were down like 15 in the ahs and then ended green for that day 

net recovered a ton from their lows after earnings

same thing happened with atkr today 

just seems like the market is somewhat forgiving this quarter could just be the general bull market happening 

fn was just way over blown for the news it was downgraded by around this 

b rileys analysts anticipate that fabrinets business will soon see headwinds stemming from weakening traction for product bundles sold in conjunction with nvidias graphics processing units gpus the artificial intelligence ai leaders gpus have been in very high demand and tech components from third parties including fabrinet have also been bundled with the advanced processors

but amazon is now moving to purchase only nvidias gpus and source additional components inhouse or through other partners b rileys analysts expect that other cloud hyperscalers including microsoft and meta platforms will adopt a similar strategy

so basically an analyst said something might happen in the future based off not much information and the stock went down like 15 

something like that happened a year or so ago with anet ive been long on them for awhile and one their earnings call they said a big customer might might be key word here cut back some capex the stock had amazing earnings and good guidance and still dropped like 15 that day because of that bit of news 

msft dropped one day like 5 because of an issue with fx trading 

i find that this is one of the benefits of activity paying attention to the market you can find quick deals  i think its also going to get gains from all the investment in llms i think in terms of just pure roi ml is much better than lms and has a lot more use cases 

like llms are cool but ml is where the money is at its been like that for a while too in terms of companies using ml  same its normally something i wouldnt buy but kind of gives me a little bit of pstg vibes in the sense they are cash flow positive now and growing

i think they are doing well with advertising right now and growing partnerships 

plus they are buying back stock already within like a year of going ipo its actually way more of an interesting company going back and looking again  normally not a company i would be but popped up when researching valuation is actually pretty solid for the company at this point 

plus they seem to be growing more in both advertising and partnerships 

their earnings letter to investors is a pretty solid read 

httpsinvestorsinstacartcomstaticfiles45c59490b81c4401ba22be639847baa7httpsinvestorsinstacartcomstaticfiles45c59490b81c4401ba22be639847baa7  some of them like google are convinced theyre closed to creating the digital super god which is infinitely valuable and are willing to pay any price if this digital super god doesnt happen soon though who knows what happens w the capex  hey im on team nvda i agree theres uses  its a good starting point once if you get more accustomed to the market you can find individual stocks you like that you think will outperform the general market  nvda just reported double beat and raise and is much more the market pltr tsla mstr and btc are all speculative and the people in them generally know that i would think  i cant change the past i started as soon as i had disposable income  costco i dont own anymore ko i bought for that reason downward protection especially since people talk nonstop about the next crash bti similar although i do believe in the bull case for it plus i wanted to test the waters with a nice dividend between the dividend and its growth im actually pretty happy with it especially since the catalyst for the big growth im expecting hasnt popped up yet  i disagree  it was a story stock and rightfully fell from that ridiculous valuation with no earnings at all really  when it dumped they grew into themselves and here we are today

dont expect it to fly anytime soon  or maybe it will  i dont anticipate that it will however its a great company and i can tell you it is managed extremely well and the outlook for it is really stunning

hang on  3 percent  yes it dropped below 200 bouncing in its range  

its consolidating  so it is just vibes  you dont have suspicious numbers to compare to other companies or to enron it just looks bad  when exactly did they fall significantly short of ar expectations in the past  not in any market really  i still dont understand the logic what about the price action since july means theyll do poorly for the next 12 months  til setting a new ath  dead  no you wrote who uses google as if perplexed by its use cases so he answered you didnt make it clear that you knew it was still highly popular and in use  ya ya invest in whatever is good for you your question was super sensationalist who used google  most dont seem to notice what the ai bros are cribbing about  i read past it just thought you were expressing two separate thoughts  bruce is probably the best ceo in canada at the moment  very valid point  perhaps but regardless i dont think that can be traced as the reason the stock is up at much as it is today or in general imo but particularly today  no it can be taken up at any point i just have a lot of spinning plates and this is one potential play  atkr numbers looked pretty rough so i think you are right market is not in a super punishing mood atm  mpwr was an ai darling due to their relationship with nvda until recently when rumors came out that nvda was alloting more to infineonrenesas since then mpwr is 40ish but those rumors were never corroborated and the company denied there be an issue so mostly that mpwr is much more ai exposed vs the other power semi laggards  nukes dont mean the whole planet will be destroyed only ukraine and the surroundings  the pe is in the 95th percentile the tariffs that mango is going to implement will wreck the economy  i guess it comes to sentiment wbd is not liked so you obviously feel it will tank i am going to hold this seems like an inflection point for the company as opposed to peak  thanks for the explanation i havent really tried swing trading like that too much but its a nice insight on a method of spotting good opportunities a skill to be able to spot those things though i think very nicely done to identify overreactions like that do you tend to stick with just trading shares rather than options  thanks ill take a look yeah i had to do a double take when i read that not your usual type of suggestions  nobody is saying that  if you listen to them or read their calls theyre seeing efficiencies and major cost reductions  im saying that commoditized chat bots are going to be one of the big ones coming up just because it isnt a huge profit jump right now doesnt mean there wont be stable and impressive growth in the near future as work on each use case continues the viability of ai replacement of human work in each case will increase tech improves over time dont give up on chat bots openai is working on a model that can make decisions on a human level if i remember my headlines correctly making decisive and actionable decisions is a huge step forward and something desperately needed before we can say we can fully replace a human in their job  i agree that nvda isnt as speculative but its often mentioned in the same sentence as the others look at rwallstreetbets for example its just picking any one of those stocks and hyping it up like theyre gonna be millionaires even on this sub we have many people asking if nows a good time to buy nvda tsla etc if theyre new to investing and hope to double their money by eoy 

id also say that these tickers are big enough to also contribute to the market nvda tsla and btc are in the trillions and the others are some of the most discussed stocks on social media  just hodl  find me another large company with their ar to rev ratio anywhere this high you wont be able to  sensationalist or not the real thing is youre just sour as its not growing  it has nothing to do with me the market is the market and what i write is how many feel and the market is backing much negative sentiment up

until there is a catalyst it will probably sit there  you arent going to lose money just be patient  or sell it or whatever  i get that 

i am getting sick of hearing about anti trust cases by our own government and extortion rackets out of europe

they wanna sue someone

sue microsoft for continuing to harass me about edge and bing i want to use chrome damnit lol

being popular shouldnt be a crime  i cant vote against mark leonard sorry plus bonus points for the best ceo beard  havent they been trying to go private for so many years for a play like this dont you basically get the benefit of both the company likley performing well long term and potentially the spike from announcing a buyout so theres a situation where even if the buyout doesnt happen you can also make some good profit seems too good to be true lol  interesting thank you might sell a bit more of my amat to diversify there  you dont know that nobody knows that  yes thats a fair assessment i have a lot less confidence in wbd today than i did in 100 meta  maybe wbd will ramp and for your sake i hope it does  for me i work from home and have access to the internet and my portfolio all day so it does make things easier 

theres way better ways to swing trade tbh usually you are going to want to do ta with it

i do some ta here and there but mainly just try to find opportunities to trade honestly been finding a lot of success with the market overractions i like to play earnings but that is extremely dumb and basically gambling lol just earnings can be a really big catalyst to move the stock price

i dont really ever do options have thought about doing it possible next year need to actually learn more about them since i just never touch them 

also keep in mind all these moves are going to be very risky ive been taking way more risk recently because i opened up a new account with 500 to see how far i can take  100 however the company is more interesting than i thought i thought of more of just a delivery company but they actually do a lot more than just delivery  tsla ill give you since its large and mag7 but btc is the crypto market which i dont feel like is correlates 11 with us equities  youre the one making the accusation why would we do the research to prove your point you can provide it if you like until then people will take what u say with a grain of salt  find me another large company with their ar to rev ratio anywhere this high

so numbers that you cant provide for some reason  i think they been saying that about tsla for years  i wouldnt say its a nobrainer jwn has been flat since may the key behind this options play is the limited risk with high potential upside a low beta stock thats primed to get taken over gives you clear risk parameters  if the rumor is true could be more downside but at this level could also be somewhat priced in but if the rumor isnt true you are getting a good deal here is my thinking  oh yes we know that its simple economics tariffs are terrible for the consumer hence the spike in inflation  i do some options trading pretty much purely on price action generally going for ones that i think are oversold and look like they might be breaking out ive lost a lot of bets but overall ive done quite well so far still a lot to learn i think ill carry on with that as my main guide but i do find it interesting when stocks tank after earnings and then reverse or the opposite identifying why that happens is pretty valuable to increase opportunities 

but yeah id definitely recommend having a look into options if you have a good track record with the short term trading or even stock picking in general as it can amplify your wins for example the powl 20 dec 400 strike call is 120 up from the close yesterday if youre trading short term and not planning to sit on it until expiry you can find one far enough out of the money thats a price youre comfortable with options can get a bad rep because people can get carried away and maybe you will too occasionally unless youre very disciplined but im very happy i discovered them the hardest part for me is knowing when to sell when youre dealing with such sudden price swings it can be a bit overwhelming sometimes  btc has extreme correlation with the nasdaq  both are tied to global liquidity  at some point the accusations will be proven correct ill just wait these things if true always appear once the slowdown starts  if you think tariffs caused that inflation spike in 2022 you are misguided also what is good for the consumer isnt the same as what it is good for the stock market  i didnt say they were not i said not 11  the longrunning correlation between bitcoin and ndx is 0805  it isnt outside the realm of possibility that nvidia could fail but even if it did your comments and responses are drama baiting drivel slop  thats a significant correlation still  no they are not they are legit concerns 

and im not saying they will fail im saying they are possibly overstating revenues by a bit to mask growth slowing more than they let on  true",0.9593,1.0,1
DOJ calls for Google to divest Chrome in antitrust push,"the department of justice doj is pushing for significant changeshttpsfinanceyahoocomnewsthedojwantstobreakupgoogleitneedstoconvinceajudgefirst090007934html to google googhttpsfinanceyahoocomquotegoog googlhttpsfinanceyahoocomquotegoogl including a divestment of its chrome browser following an august court ruling that found the company had illegally monopolized the search market

yahoo finances senior legal reporter alexis keenanhttpswwwyahoocomauthoralexiskeenan joins morning brief cohosts brad smithhttpswwwyahoocomauthorbradleysmith and seana smithhttpswwwyahoocomauthorseanasmith to discuss what this means for google and its parent company alphabet  
  
keenan notes that while google has opposed the dojs proposals calling them a radical agenda that could harm consumers and the tech industry the case becomes more complicated with the upcoming administration change

in my opinion googl shares are extremely undervalued and this situation will resolve itself once trump takes control my advice buy",Former_Drawer6732,2024-11-21 21:24:05,403,235,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwii2b/doj_calls_for_google_to_divest_chrome_in/,,"why is the stock down today given the news was leaked on tuesday and the report was available yesterday  wonder how this will even play out if the current doj will be replaced in two months anyways  people working at the doj    i bought more its heavily undervalued just dcaing  ok so in other words its early black friday  what a dumb remedyits not even a remedy chromium is the source of both chrome and edge it is an opensource product this will change nothing it also shows that the doj is clueless in this matter  if alphabet were split into separate companiesyoutube search waymo healthcare etcthe combined value would likely exceed its current valuation google is trading at a pe ratio of 21 with a forward pe of 1617 which is remarkably low especially when you compare it to tesla valued at 1 trillion despite generating just 10 billion in revenue  can someone explain why search is a monopoly as opposed to just a popular product there are alternatives out there but most people choose to use search because its widely regarded as better also microsoft have railroaded me to use bing more than google ever have search  if the doj is about fairness and equality they should also force microsoft to sell edge and apple to sell safari also if google isnt allowed to be the default search engine then do the same for all browsers pop up a choice of search engines to select from or let the user decide on something else if its not listed  this is just the biden administration bringing out all the existing cases to public so that the next trump administration have a harder time closing them they want to put it in public before the heads of prosecution teams are kicked out  
just lots of showmanship

i expect more doj activity in coming days  if this was the only bad news around google would people sell

i mean if google announces it stops supporting chrome would this really hurt their business more than the layoffs would save

from my perspective the browser business used to be an unprofitable way to lure people into the google ecosystem but now for google its nothing more than an expensive hedge

as a web developer google to me has always been a pioneer and advocate for an open web and web technologies even as more and more people shy away from the browser the way i see it if theyre forced to exit this market itll simply hurt this market not them  so doj is done with going after trump and now decide to pick on google just great  these viscid lawyers should be forced to use bing everyday for the rest of their life  i thought that the doj would just make google stop paying apple to be the default search engine and have them pay a fine instead they want them to completely divest from chrome which is definitely interesting  yes bought it yesterday now its done 6 percent  get the hell out of my stock doj  can someone please help me understand the impact of this divestment it does not sound like a big deal at all  is this doj even gonna be around in a month  buy the dip  google chrome should be worth about 100billion doj undercutting google seems like a serious breach of law and overreach hopefully we get a new doj soon  is this venezuela or cuba  same story as usual retail panic sell on garbage clickbait news will be back to 170s in next days if not even in after hours  what a weird remedy what would that even accomplish  divest deez nuts   chrome is worth at least 100b who can afford to buy chrome without becoming a target of anti trust regulators anyway theres a shortlist of companies that can afford chrome and for whom the acquisition makes strategic business sense amznmsftmeta maybe one other i cant think of  does anyone know what happens to options in the event of google breakup do option holders get new calls for those that have been around longer how long would such a breakup even take  would actually make a lot of sense for wikipedia to scoop it up  its not that big a deal for google but the doj will likely lose  what happens to google share if chrome gets seperated from google do share holders get share of chrome or what  so wait further for the stock to decrease and invest or invest now  this seems like a dumb push if you make them sell chrome because its too powerful then whoever buys it will just become a monopoly   such a waste of time for everyone involved

so what happens to whoever buys chrome are they targeted next just an endless circlejerk  buying the dip  was selling puts today if it indeed breaks up then all investors get shares of chrome which will be probably easier to managae as a standalone entity 

this will recover in a week or two  im really sorry everyone i finally bought stocks in google after contemplating it for years moments after i hit the purchase button this news article was released now they are to be forced to sell chrome because they have a monopoly on the search engines which odd because i use ms edge and bing regularly just so you are aware i am also looking to purchase stock in microsoft apple and nvidia in the upcoming days s  im loading up gmail isnt going anywhere  why cant chrome form its own org and split  oh wow  this will change everything   i no longer have to close firefox and open chrome in order to use the google searcher  the only reason to use chrome is its integration with all google services i guess firefox will become more popular again  bought the dip 

even with a delayed eventual sale of chrome the reason google search is dominant is due to capability and not default in chrome  overreaction 

inverse reddit mute out the noise buy leaps dca shares if you dont think googl is a monster go stick to etfs  google is fcked i dont believe google will prevail gov doesnt understand tech 

however google has strong portfolio with google ventures  google is not one trick pony  i think its funny considering openai is gouging search result shares at a pretty hefty rate id imagine as openai keeps developing gpt products the share google has on search results is only going to shrink 

as for google being the default browser on a significant portion of devicesproducts i dont personally understand the issue shrinking their share will only cause apple or others to move in gaining a disproportionate share  im ok with this i already gave up on chrom tbh

_looks left then right_

edge is better    how does this make sense  chrome is a free product  google spends a lot of money maintaining the software so the browser itself is a money loser  how does a buyer make money with it  the equivalent is firefox which relies on handouts from google and the organization still cannot keep its head above water  no idea 6 down off news we already knew and id thought wed digested  market was too busy pumping bitcoinmstr to notice  honestly i dont understand  and yet apple is only slightly down

i swear that company is like a cockroach cupertino could take a direct hit from an icbm and still come out smelling like roses

wanna talk cellular monopoly look no further than their parasitic app store do nothing take 30 

i have a pretty decent book library on my ipad and unfortunately i am tied to their ecosystem forever because of it either i have an i product or i cant read my books

honestly im surprised they havent just thrown isearch out there people would flock to it because everything apple related is just better 

the failure of the vision pro and europe telling them to go screw themselves over their charging ports were great days  this is pure retail selling even the official leak was known already before market open yet no drop the process will take atleast until next summer and chrome sell of wont happen under trump  ive been buying on the news but didnt get the memo on the dojs recommendation for google to sell chrome which is probably at least 90 of their revenue  maybe im too dumb to see the writing on the wall  this proposal is moronic but ive seen stranger and more shocking things in my life  

for example a few years ago i snuck up on my now ex girlfriend surfing online  she didnt know i was behind her so didnt bother to hide her screen  i peeked and fuckin saw something that rocked me to this day she was using bing to search  and i dont mean to search for a chrome downloadi mean looking for avengers movie reviews n shit  bots trading  apparently because the headlines said chrome but people got glimpse into the report and it had more specifics and other things other than chrome  tbh ive only got conspiracy theories  efficient markets hypothesis emh im a strong believer in semistrong emh meaning all the news you see is factored into the price of a stock by the time it is released but insider information is not what youre seeing is most likely preadjustments being made before more news is released how far into the future will it be released no clue but just know you probably wont be able to time the market with public news  no clue hedgies felt like stepping in to short 

i bought the dip  pump and dump   the trump administration will probably settle this case

 trump has said many times that he does not want to break google up  which is why alphabet stock pumped on the election result this aligns with his pro america stance  that the usa should do everything to retain its absolute dominance in technology china is afraid of google trumps main issue with google is censorship  so hell likely drop this lawsuit in exchange for some sort of compromise on censorship
 google hasnt even filed an appeal  and it is within their right to realistically even if a breakup was eventually ordered itll be at least 5 years away or more itll just drag out until nothing happens microsoft does this all the time the doj has had a pisspoor track record of going after tech companies and theres nothing to suggest that its going to be different now especially with a republican supreme court  who will likely lean protectionist
 pedo gaetz who has previously come out as antibig tech is no longer up for ag suspect the new appointee will be more frieldy to big corporates and more aligned with trumps overall agenda

thats just my guess but who the hell knows  same what matters is the stance of next administration though the next administration probably wont drop the case entirely they might use it as a barginchip  pretty sure trump has said he doesnt like google he says he googles himself and only sees negative articles lmao and of course that means theyre fake and bad for america  a move like this in the market shows me goog is being attacked regardless of president  same  i had a 175 csp so i wont be dcaing lol  nothing is heavily undervalued in this market  same  can you explain i am invested obviously not selling but undervalued sure heavily not so sure  alphabet c now with a 6 sale for black friday what a nice move from them   as a nonus person its so funny to see the doj trying so hard to destroy one of their very own american tech giants with so much valuable ip in ai and across various industries whats the end goal here theyre behaving no different to the ccp essentially  lina khan doesnt care she just hates to us country and wants to hurt us shes doing as much damage as she can before losing the chairmanship   thats not how googles business model works

googles healthcare  science divisions are worthless without google cloud  ai waymo is not profitable and is being propped up by google search youtube will likely lose its profitability once it begins serving less effective ads because it got severed from google search google chrome android  or the other divisions that actually collect customer data

google is profitable because of how well the different parts work together its impossible to see how googles valuation would improve if you take it apart

the doj is completely off the mark here the primary beneficiary of googles monopoly isnt google

its the consumer who gets free gmail free access to googles productivity and office apps fast and reliable search and all the advancements that come from googles investments in alphafold

fyi the last time the doj pulled this move with bell systems local telephone service rates began to rise faster than the rate of inflation as they were no longer subsidised by the longdistance rates

and of course bell labs prestige faded away too leaving it as a shell of its former self  fair but google isnt literally being run by a con man  some of the spinoffs couldnt make it on their own as they are funded by google we dont even know if youtube makes a profit after cost and they probably get subsidized servers from google waymo is a money loser and would need to be funded if they were split off from google

also chrome doesnt make any money  10 billion in profits but yes point taken markets price companies into perpetuity and anticipate significant market loss without chrome  alphabet is carried by google through advertising and youtube again through advertising  dont compare to tesla lol  i wouldnt mind baby alphabets the parts separated would be much more then the whole  deleted  true the biggest drawback of google is its current leadership that prefers playing politics over profits

splitting it would give us significant chance for at least some baby companies having actual profitoriented ceo  i would love to know this too google search and chrome are both free to consumers and have numerous competitors the problem is the competitors suck im not sure why thats googles problem or means they should subject to an antitrust lawsuit  probably that said they cant go after every overpowered company at the same time  not as fair since half the life for some reason runs on chromium


and if google is not allowed to be default search engine its not that all search engines should get the same hit 


google search has market dominance governments goal is to reduce a single companies monopoly then by all means they just need to kill google search to make market more competitive and friendly for consumers we dont operate on le made up fairness and whatever it means for each person  then for godsake start selling to boost the rest of us sacrifice your money for the good  they beg for donations theyre not remotely close to being able to afford the market cap  reddit agrees with you all the top comments are saying the same thing you are youre definitely not inversing reddit when youre buying google  inverse reddit  short google  hmm english  a lot of the time when you see something like this its because theres more news to come insiders start selling large position sizes large institutions start to notice and begin trimming risk etc

i swing trade a lot and its not at all uncommon to see a stock take off or sell off several days before a market moving announcement people think that insider trading gets punished in this world but the sec is kind of a joke whatever the punishment is its not good enough to stop it from happening

some sort of news will probably get dropped over the next few days that will justify the drop  greater macro forces are driving the market down than just this one equity issue  maybe mm just flushing out google call holders for friday  like when lunr jumped 50 on news which we already pretty much knew  i swear this explains a lot of why other stocks were undervalued until today as well mstr is where the action has been until today i know i wasnt looking at anything else  lol

markets dont move in a straight line andor unaffected by related news nvda earnings or geopolitical news possible icbm used or related financial reports being released finviz

youre welcome  elon issued a press release that his doj would be pushing for significant changes to google  apple is viewed as a safe low risk stock not my personal view but institutions love this thing they havent grown in over 2 years yet keep going up due to their bs apple intelligence announcement tim cook mastered how to suck up to trump during his first term so hell keep them out of regulatory cross hairs  exactly why i will never buy apple products trash ecosystem overpriced products still have an ipad from back in 2014 and the pain to get any normal files from my windows pc working on that piece of garbage atleast my mediocre surface is easy to use put a file on my usb transfer to surface done trash apple products   do nothing take 30 

what they did was create the highest security mosttrusted software market space paired with the constellation of devices guaranteed to work with them also they continue to have rigorous code checking of all updates of all apps by humans in a highly expensive process  removed  retail is not moving googl lol  nope


the fact that qqq has recovered a good bit of their losses and google continues to stay in the dumps just screams more institutions fleeing or at the very least panic selling of call options   removed  this comment is so funny to me lmfao  you dont need to grasp at straws looking for reasons to make your preconceived notions actually make sense the simple answer is markets are irrational and inneficent  dump and pump  all we need to know is pelosis positions is she long or short and what expirations is she targeting  the final call is up to the judge now the case has been decided there is no backing out  i guess would be that trump is looking to hammer techs from bad behavior not break them up for financialmonopoly reasons  but thats just imho  trump is purely transactional  if google gives him something he will make it go away  not really anymore after sundar praised him lmao httpswwwthevergecom2024102724280799sundarsundarwhosagreatguyverysmart  on jre trump said sundar called him after the fry stunt to mention this was maybe the biggest search of all time  i think that ring kiss may have saved goog  wouldnt be so sure djt is more pro us business and focused on maintaining our edge over china and europe breaking up google hurts one of our best and most innovative businesses especially in the race on ai also sundar pichai just had a call with djt yesterday which will go a long way in placating his ego hes has made a number of comments lately about how google has praised him for being the number one in search vance on the other hand has been supportive of lina khan but not sure he will sway djt  it is trading at a submarket multiple about 20x this years earnings and 18x next years despite having double digit growth and being debt free  6 discount with a minimum order value of 176  agreed the fact that she even got the position is a joke  who says these spinoffs cant continue their cooperation if amazon split into online shopping and aws does that mean shopping cant use aws  of all the pharmaceutical monopoliesduopolies the doj has decided a free web browser is the problem lol

consumers will absolutely suffer in the long run when youtube has to run more ads and gmail starts only saving emails for like a year   google is profitable because of how well the different parts work together

hard disagree

a stand alone youtube would still be the most profitable 
streamer on earth  

chrome and chromebooks would be a fine business with youtube

google cloud doesnt need waymo

and so on 

theres a couple ick synergies here and there  buttheres no existential need for all of these and search and everything else to be under one listless ceo  true  but can we discuss how basically useless hes been

to clarify when i say he i mean googles sundar pichai  to be fair if they were a seperate company they would be able to raise funds individually focus on efficiency and profitability etc

i get your point but the structure of the split off companies would definitely change  im deeply skeptical that youtube is carrying the company id be shocked if they had a double digit profit margin on youtube imo theyre probably just barely profitable considering the following

 the vast majority of viewers dont pay for the service

 theres a ton of storage costs for all their videos and 37 million new videos are uploaded every day

 the vast majority of their videos are net losers that will never recoup their storage costs and other expenses

 a big chunk of their ad revenue goes to the content creators themselves plus theres a ton of other expenses that i didnt even list here  going private requires buying everyone else out 

you dont just go private and nuke all commons i am not even sure that would be legal  yeah that would be a universal scam  how is he playing politics  peter lynch recommends buying shares of the spunoff entity as opposed to the original company when this happens  in addition i dont see what the problem is for a google product to utilize another google product its normal for companies to make their different assets work with each other and advertise to use more of their own products 

if i buy a google phone it makes sense that the default browser is a google browser as long as the default browser can be changed i dont see what the big hoopla is apple does this with their products too it makes sense because you want your varying products to work with each other  then break up microsoft to they own office productivity with windows office teams linkedin copilot and azure is the fastest growing cloud service  i fully understand that alphabet should be prohibited from making payments to apple for example to set google as the default browser from an antitrust perspective but forcing google to sell chrome and committing itself not to develop an alternative internet browser for 5 years is about the most ridiculous thing you can do if you want to fight monopolism free market means the best product decides the hurdles to creating a search engine are not high google simply offers the best product if that goes through every company with high margins is monopolistic nvidia apple meta amazon  exactly lmao this doesnt become a meta esque moment until it is probing around its pre covid record from 2020 and social media is hating on the stock


not saying thats going to happen but its more likely than it seeing 200 with most social media in general continuing to say to hammer all dips on the stock  im in it for the long term so im probably going to be happy holding my google stock but if this ends up being true then thatll be pretty annoying  to be fair a lot of is is quant cascading yeah some insider or two makes some moves but the aberration triggers algos that continue the trend which can cascade quickly into the news cycle  theres no more news possible the case is paused until google responds in mid december  i wont sell any of my shares unless li lu sells his  read the report youll realize the headline or chrome wasnt the only thing and people picked up on that  as much as i hate to admit it i think i can understand why its hard to prosecute

they could easily say what do you meani sold because of the doj ruling

insider trading must be far harder to prove when it occurs right after a publiclydisclosed event and they must wait for situations exactly like that  if its not good enough how does the us do it im not aware of any insider trading  pretty strongly doubt it


this is so bad that youre probably going to have to 3 day rule it on the stock if youre interested in initiating fresh buys and really i wouldnt be surprised if this sparked a trend lower for a while


if so best case is the nasdaq doesnt turn around next year and it bottoms again in the upper 140s  source i cant find this online  apple ai coming to everything everywhere all at once get it now  they seemingly have unlimited stock buyback cash too  i think they will expand into the healthcare hardware and software market i dont think they have been developing all of the apple watch health technology for fun for the past 10 years they already have partnerships with some healthcare providers  i giggled like a little kid when europe forced them to accept usbc charging ports  nah bro i could do it with a raspberry pi trust me

import app_store  the algos that follow  prior to today goog was outperforming spy and qqq itll probably end the year ahead ignore the noise they print money  he said splitting google would be unfair further more it doesnt fit into his picture of american protectionism  short term yes but market is effiecient in the longterm  not grasping at straws by saying the public info is factored into the price of a stock and the only people with an edge are the people with insider information common belief among many advisors and economists  trump and dump  not true  google still has the right to appeal at which point its likely that judge mehta will stay the enforcement process  trump is the only politician that operates transactionally the rest dont participate in that  jd vance has repeatedly openly said that he is against us monopolies and hates big tech  its at 223 pe  if the doj requires them to be sold off what youre asking is if someone bought online shopping would aws let them use their services maybe but theyd have to pay for it now theyre a different company  i mean if amazon shopping uses aws under the same terms as before the split youd probably be gagging for the doj to fine another antitrust lawsuit against you that would be obviously very illegal

it would be like a us company thats banned from trading with iran because of us sanctions deciding it will trade with india knowing the indian intermediary just plans to ship its products to iran anyway

youd be rekt

not that thats likely to happen anyway the only way it would make sense for shopping to continue working with aws under the same terms is if the shareholder structure remains the same after as it did before

needless to say that wouldnt happen because then what would be the point of the breakup  most services would collapse whether you disagree or not

the reason why youtube makes money is through google ads chromebooks operate at a net loss

if split google search  ads will definitely stay together 

youtube would become like twitch if separated amazon still funds twitch because it cant turn a profit  i do find it interesting how google never reveals how much profit youtube actually generates i dont doubt its profitable but running the worlds biggest streamer with more than 37 million new videos uploaded daily is expensive af and dont forget youtube still needs to pay out the youtube creators 55 of all ad revenue

also google clouds biggest selling point over aws and azure is that its integrated with google ffs

like you can take your website traffic from google search and run your data analytics on cloud

the whole thing works together because it does  stock price is hugging near an ath  i think he been doing just fine if you are a stock holder  not sure if sundar personally but the google as search engine definitely skewed hard left during the past few years and googles staff is famously very antirepublican either in donations activist politics etc 

meaning that boards either doesnt care or supports this  i agree with that break it up rather than allow even more acquisitions  marketing dominance per se isnt a problem its when it gives you powerful leverage that it is in the last 20 years the only product microsofts marketing dominances were useful for leveraging in order to boost its share from nothing to relevance was teams screwing slack and in the end both were leapfrogged by zoom compare it to google who had a surprise leapfrog in ai by openai but no one rules them out coming on top because of the companys dominance in search streaming youtube mobile android and ads  free market means the best product decides

its not free market each one of these companies own tens of thousands of patents its 70781 in google case

so if i ever literally ripped off shit google does made chrome with blackjack and hookers i would get sued the very next day if i ignored all of that the law enforcement would break down my door and use force to subdue my company

there is no such thing as best product when patent system only allows one such product on the market to begin with thus establishing endless government sanctioned monopolies usa doesnt have any free market in any sense what so ever especially when hilariously the scandinavian countries known for their socialism ranks more free more ruggedly capitalistic than usa

there is a great video on youtube you hate all these companies for the same reason that presents this very well it also very well explains why enshittification is so easy to pull off and consumers cant do anything about it

is about the most ridiculous thing you can do if you want to fight monopolism

also why its ridiculous explain it in economic theory i say if they kill the company that holds market power it would simply make the market more free and competitive it is also the very first thing all governments would do if they wanted to solve such a thing who made it why it was made for what reason it was made what effect on society you think it has are all things not part of theory unless you are arguing that they are not doing enough to kill it then we agree its ridiculous  they dont have a leg to stand on chromium is open source it doesnt make sense to force google to divest from chrome dont like it use something else built on chromium or use firefox or edge  i pulled it out of my ass  the give away should have been his doj  and then of course apple being apple dont implement it the same as the ecosystem leading to 4 different hdmi adapter dongles that you can now buy off a shelf oh but they can all use the same port how quaint oh they do that on both sides of the dongle too for a total of 6 different dongles you can buy only one of which will connect your firewire apple display to a macbook pro  algos follow retail traders be serious  would existing googl shareholders get stock in the spinoff chrome company  nah its very doubtful


this kind of move has typically preceded google underperforming for weeks since 2023


most likely case is itll try to bounce tomorrow and fail and sell more before bottoming 


my price target for eoy is seriously just 180 and it may have already been seen  i literally said that in my comment already i personally dont think vance will have much sway over djt djt is focused on beating the rest of the world and bolstering us business thats why hes proposing massive tariffs on china and europe see his quote from last month when asked if they should be broken up he has his reservations about breaking google up i think he would propose a lesser remedy to the anti competitve practice at hand which is paying apple to be the default on safari

how they became a power is you know really the discussion he said at the same time its a very dangerous thing because want to have great companies  we dont want china to have these companies right now china is afraid of google  jd vance is getting ready to assume the most useless position ever devised by man 

the vice presidency is the epitome of check and a chair

there is however one slight deviation going for him trump is old as fuck  even without splitting isnt the cost of service captured in accounting example if aws services are used for prime streaming isnt that cost captured   yes but then aws makes more money so the combined value of two stocks assuming split will still be the same  the doj cant force a company to not cooperate with another and doesnt have a say on prices and contractual agreements am i right otherwise its the doj micromanaging companies now musk was right to want to dismantle their reach if this is true  youtube doesnt turn a profit   the reason why youtube makes money is through google ads

while there is a good chance much of ad infra team at google does both google and yt ads a split is not going to cause major issue   i do find it interesting how google never reveals how much profit youtube actually generates i dont doubt its profitable 

yes they do and its absurdly profitable  it has been for many years

a lot of people dont realize that because theyve been fed the nonsensical lie that netflix is the only airquotes profitable streamer  people have been erroneously trained to forget that youtube exists and is a streaming service  

 but running the worlds biggest streamer with more than 37 million new videos uploaded daily is expensive af 

that too is what would best be called truthy  that means something that most people would casually assume to be true but actually isnt  youtube infrastructure is so massive that the economies of scale are unheard of  their cdn is second to none so a lot of what people think must be expensive for them is really offloaded to the end of the distribution line isps and related parties


 and dont forget youtube still needs to pay out the youtube creators 55 of all ad revenue

yeah imagine only getting paid 45 cents of every dollar for doing nothing  ill take it  i assume you recognize mastercard and visa as financial powerhouses  they do it by skimming 175 to 2  so skimming 45 is pretty damn lucrative  even greedy apple only skims 30 and im sure youd agree apple is lucrative too

not only that but youtube only pays out money based on success  only videos with big revenue trigger significant payment to the content maker  studios and netflix would die for such an arrangement  they have to front billions in content creation and then roll the dice hoping that a few of their investments work  with youtube its structure so they only pay for hits proportionally

youtube is a gold mine  and for reasons that should be obvious google is very happy continung to keep that realization under the radar for as long as they have

but back to the key point youtube is a wonderful monstrously profitable busones with or without google docs   google cloud is a wodnefuly profitable monster with or without waymo  and so on

your implication that youtube is some borderline fledgling operation that can only turn a profit if its kept together is totally false

 also google clouds biggest selling point over aws and azure is that its integrated with google 

false as false could be

 like you can take your website traffic from google search and run your data analytics on cloud

wait you think those are the only ways to track traffic and that theres no competition in analytics  youre just wrong my friend



 the whole thing works together because it does

yeah no  look im not here to bash the stock but youre factually wrong

at the current peak of 164 its nowhere near its ath of 195  

and its been dead money for several years  theres hundreds of better performing stocks over that time

but what i was mainly referring to is for anyone thats old and knew google when it started and has tracked it to today there was a time when google was mind blowingly amazing  theyd produce innovations almost weekly that seemed impossible  we used to pay 25 a month in 1990s dollars for mediocre and capacitylimited email  google said we just invented unlimited email where the capacity grows faster than you can use it  and its packed with features  and the price is free   and its available right now  no waiting

even their search was unheard of  and maps  and a hundred other head spinning innovations

since the current ceo took over neither you or i could point to a single amazing innovation by google  theyve just milked the old stuff to death  worse theyve degraded or discontinued most of it

theyve gone from a source of inspiration to a lame and evil ad agency  deleted  the stock has performed amazingly well the last 3 years

just look at a 3 year chart from today

amazing right

lol

gtfo  didnt he state that he doesnt want employees talking about politics after the election was over

as for the search if you want the right answers its not hard to skew left when the right is spitting out everything that pops in their mind people want the righttruthful answers ai is just going to bury shitty results

its not just googles staff that skews to the left most college educated people skew to the left in the us if college degrees were a requirement to vote kamala wouldve won and thats a fact  demographically it isnt some conspiracy that young welleducated creativeforward looking individuals are leftleaning lol that is hardly google playing politics  reality has a leftleaning bias search results reflect that if i ask google about the circumference of earth the results shouldnt be propping up flat earth conspiracies if i ask google about climate change it shouldnt be propping up oil companies saying climate change is nothing to worry about reality has a leftleaning bias 

dont get mad that google isnt prioritizing misinformation be mad at the people spreading misinformation   definitely skewed hard left during the past few years

lol this just betrays a complete lack of knowledge on how google functions 

the google bot is what creates the index there is not someone furiously copyingpasting links into a search results page for every query the google bot does not weight very heavily some fucking mommy blog or tinydickpatriotorg when calculating the position in the results nor should they especially when there are better sources of information like gov or edu sites

this is how google has functioned since its inception right wingers just have this idiotic persecution complex that is impossible to shake  i agree if they wanted to deal a blow to google on the way out they shouldve suggested google detach youtube that wouldve been significant at least 

side note i already use firefox and think its great  this is what i dont get this isnt the same as the mswindows antitrust from years ago but you install an os and you have to search out google chrome its not being forced on anyone at all chrome isnt even the best browser yet people will actively seek it out and download it

i buy pixel phones because i really like them a lot and they work well i expect google products on a google phone just like i expect apple products on an apple device  its about weakening googles search monopoly

chrome gathers a ton of data that other browsers cant that helps ensure its search dominance for example if you search on something at google chrome will tell google how long you stayed on the page that you clicked on that search link for which will help them determine if thats a good or bad link bing duckduckgo etc cant do the same thing when youre using their search on chrome hence it entrenches google searchs dominance which not even microsoft can compete against which is why the doj sued them in the first place  dont you find it a little unnerving that your joke was taken seriously

vince mcmahons wife is going to be running the department of education everything is on the table at this point  momentum algos will follow retail thats why they pay for and front run retail order flow  bro youve seen spikes or drops of stocks with similar tickers retail does drive  remindme 3 months  ironic because all the democrats claimed kamala was a great candidate because she was the vp  i think i follow aws and prime are owned by the same company no this would be different in that from what i can tell theyre telling google no more owning a browser to direct traffic to your services you have to sell chrome to someone else  i think its consolidated revenue and treated one time with the rest discarded  theyre requiring them to sell it  not splinter off based on what i read would be like amazon selling off one of the two they wouldnt care about the stock price of an entirely different company  so the doj is doing all this and google can create a spinoff company buy chrome and resume doing exactly what theyre being sued for that seems like a waste 

if thats not what youre saying then im confused bc it certainly seems like they want google to outright sell chrome  the answer no one knows google doesnt release youtube profitability only revenues

in truth its probably profitable but its unclear just how profitable it is because there is nothing comparable to it netflix isnt comparable at all because netflix has a limited collection of titles

there is only 42000 hours of playable content on netflix youtube has 300000 hours of new content uploaded to it every single fucking hour

so anyone who wants to estimate youtube profitability using netflix numbers is 100 out of their mind

i imagine youtube gets a steeeeeeeeep discount on all its massive computing needs through google

breakup  goodbye discounts

i doubt youtube would survive without google  youtube makes money through google ads so its really google ads that is profitable 

without google ads it would take some time before the new company can get their ad system polished  google isnt a lemonade stand this isnt a pitcher splitting from the table   heard of a thing called computing costs  you have clearly not heard of nor ridden in a waymo that shit is mind blowing impressive as is alphafold hell tpus are on their fifth generation by now while everyone else is working on their first and begging nvda for blackwell

shit the recent gemini launch actually puts google ahead on benchmarking against chatgpt 

not to mention that their revenue is still growing double digits and they are printing cash out the ass end of their business  talking about tesla since he is referring to elon as con man  ytd its up 38  how is it a laggard when its beating the indexes  im down for tesla hating but be realistic about this instead of making alternative realities  after the election was over is the important part here in another words too little too late

since they didnt hedge against trump win their shareholders will now pay the price and that is something i call shitty leadership sorry

note if they love truthful answers so much how come they did shill so hard with misleading polls everyone else in silicon valley seemed to have a clue way in advance even zuck and bezos did  1 didnt trump get the majority of young vote

2 as to the creatives it was true for quite some time  but i feel the zeitgeist changing left went censorshipheavy too hard lately and a lot of new creatives skew right because of that just see whats popular with genz for fucks sake left it aint 

3 that leaves you only with welleducated which id call just educated at this point hardly an electionwinning demographics  right wingers are fucking out of hand at this point

the idea that the google robot that powers the indexing and response of literal billions of queries daily is somehow manually manipulated in any meaningful way to suppress the truth is peak fucking lunacy what these people really want is a confirmation bias engine which does not challenge their world view in any way which is going to make the eventual collapse of the collective delusion absolutely wild  reality has a leftleaning biassearchhttpbiassearch results reflect that

  there is a reason we havent had a vp win the presidency in over 30 years

they didnt have much else to use to pump her up and it fed right into republicans narrative that she had a lot to do with bidens policies when it reality its still just a check and a chair position with no real authority or responsibility

vance wont be any different only difference is he may have the only sure fire path a vp has to the oval office  so are they asking online shopping to sell aws or aws to sell online shopping  not even that i meant direct cooperation between alphabet and the separate independent new company with no link to googlechrome 

im pretty sure google is not selling chrome those clowns at the doj will be out in a couple months and even if they were not appeals would take years  google  has already internally organized yt as separate org there are few common teams yes but spinning out yt will not be as painful as you think

cloud and search that will be much more painful because search doesnt use gcp but both run on same data centers  the revenue cost profit that google report on earning report already consider computing costs if yt has to pay 50 more to google cloud to run the same computations then google cloud makes 50 more money

so if the company were to split then yes there will be one time cost for transformation but net flow of cash to google isnt changing   you have clearly not heard of nor ridden in a waymo 

why make idiotic and false accusations like that  you lower your already near zero credibility  same with the other techno hype that has no relevance outside of fanboy world

 not to mention that their revenue is still growing double digits 

no average normal person cares about such thing nor is double digit growth even noteworthy let alone mind blowing innovative

its sad when people cant set aside their supercharged fanboy emotions and just stay objective and factual  didnt realize you were talking tesla sorry


will delete  so buy some puts

trump isnt in office yet so according to you this retribution hasnt begun yet

as for the polls did google buy all those media companies that did the polling  gen z is about to learn what happens when a republican crashes the economy and there is no stimulus coming

they fucking lucked out that the democrats were in control of congress when covid happened for the first time probably ever regular people like them got rescued that will not happen this go around they will feed on table scraps like gen y did when the great recession happened  lol compared to your i refuse to learn and grow from new information so i will continue to blindly dig my head in the sand and lap up all the russian propaganda fed to me i will not critically think once in doing so

yeah im good have fun with your google thesis cant wait for you to put your money where your mouth is and buy some puts  yeah its just that people like one and not the other which is unfair i guess  it seems like the doj wants a sale into a different company not necessarily a spinoff chrome cant survive on its own  to clarify this is google not amazon from what i read theyre telling google to sell chrome and disallow them from even owning a browser its not going to be a stock split where they splinter off maybe im naive but they arent going to allow google to open up a subsidiary or shell company and buy chrome so business can continue as usual it would be like telling amazon to sell off online shopping to open up the market to new sites offering the same thing those places could still use aws like a new browser could use google ads for their data etc 

  
the point of contention and my understanding is the suit is trying to stop google from using their own portal to the internet to direct people to use their services  that doesnt change what the suit says this is a confusing angle like youre arguing its irrelevant what the suit says bc its not going to happen ok go off  alright ill take your word  yea yea yea 

if google charged youtube the same as it charged any other company no one would even say the words antitrust and monopolistic practices   no puts i just see the stock stagnating while rest of sp500 actually grows

 well the irony is that bidens doj got them killed isnt it it really is a circular firing squad the left trump will just gleefully finish it

 media companies did their own shilling and google did its own take too come on i use google news among others dont tell me that coveragechoice of articles was even remotely unbiased and realistic it was not  keeping selling or splitting chome is irrelevant doing that with yt waymo or gcp is what is more interesting  hey you do you

just a fyi this case started in trump 2016 so the doj is actually doing its job

as for the media companies most of the owners are on the right including cnn so im not sure whos shilling they report and you read about it",0.6249,0.9998,1

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"intuit shares fell 6 in extended trading thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts estimates due to some sales being delayed

heres how the company performed in comparison with lseg consensus

earnings per share 250 adjusted vs 235 expected

revenue 328 billion vs 314 billion

revenue increased 10 year over year in the quarter which ended oct 31 according to a statement net income fell to 197 million or 70 cents per share from 241 million or 85 cents per share a year ago

while results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates secondquarter guidance was light intuit said it anticipates a singledigit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the turbotax desktop software in retail environments while that will affect revenue timing it wont have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year

intuit called for secondquarter earnings of 255 to 261 per share with 381 billion to 385 billion in revenue the consensus from lseg was 320 per share and 387 billion in revenue

for the full year intuit expects 1916 to 1936 in adjusted earnings per share on 1816 billion to 1835 billion in revenue that implies revenue growth of between 12 and 13 analysts polled by lseg were looking for 1933 in adjusted earnings per share and 1826 billion in revenue

revenue from intuits global business solutions group came in at 25 billion in the first quarter the figure was up 9 and in line with estimates according to streetaccount formerly known as the small business and selfemployed segment the group includes mailchimp quickbooks small business financing and merchant payment processing

we are seeing good progress serving midmarket customers in mailchimp but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers sandeep aujla intuits finance chief said on a conference call with analysts we are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve firsttime use and customer retention

better outcomes are a few quarters away aujla said

creditkarma revenue came in at 524 million above streetaccounts 430 million consensus

at thursdays close intuit shares were up about 9 so far in 2024 while the sp 500 has gained almost 25 in the same period

goodarzi said on cnbc that hes personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration

on the earnings call goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy

our belief which is not baked into our guidance is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025 particularly just with some of the things that i mentioned earlier around just interest rates jobs the regulatory environment he said these things have a real burden on businesses and we believe that a better future is to come

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at gap during its fiscal third quarter but the apparel company still posted betterthanexpected results leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year 

gap which runs old navy banana republic athleta and its namesake banner is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 15 and 2 compared with previous guidance of up slightly thats ahead of the 04 growth that lseg analysts had expected and bodes well for the allimportant holiday shopping season which is now underway 

the company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected

shares surged about 13 in extended trading

heres how the nations largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what wall street was anticipating based on a survey of analysts by lseg

 earnings per share 72 cents vs 58 cents expected
 revenue 383 billion vs 381 billion expected

gaps reported net income for the threemonth period that ended nov 2 was 274 million or 72 cents per share compared with 218 million or 58 cents per share a year earlier 

sales rose to 383 billion up about 2 from 378 billion a year earlier

across gaps business unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2 ceo richard dickson told cnbc in an interview 

we had unusual circumstances hurricanes storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact said dickson adding the storms affected old navy gaps largest brand by revenue the most 

as soon as the weather turned around sales rebounded and the holiday shopping season is off to a strong start so far said dickson 

we are energized about the holiday our teams are really focused on executing our plans if we compare ourselves to where we were last year our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year he said weve got stronger brand identities and were more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about driving better product better pricing more relevance better consumer experience and excellence in execution 

since dickson took the helm of gap a little over a year ago hes worked to turn around the business after years of declines under his direction the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row but the company is still smaller than it once was and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive fullprice selling

heres a closer look at each brands performance 

old navy gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1 to 22 billion while comparable sales were flat shy of the 09 growth that analysts had expected according to streetaccount old navys kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather said dickson 

gap gaps eponymous banner grew 1 to 899 million during the quarter while comparable sales were up 3  better than the 23 growth wall street expected according to streetaccount the brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product the company said 

banana republic the trendy workwear line grew sales 2 to 469 million while comparable sales fell 1 a bit worse than the 08 drop that streetaccount had expected the brand has worked to turn around its mens business which drove results during the quarter overall it is still focused on fixing the fundamentals the company said 

athleta the athleisure arm of gaps empire grew sales by 4 to 290 million while comparable sales were up 5 the results werent comparable to estimates in the yearago period comparable sales were down 19 at athleta under its new ceo former alo yoga boss chris blakeslee the brand has managed to turn things around

httpswwwweforumorgstories202408healthcarecostsdigitaltechhttpswwwweforumorgstories202408healthcarecostsdigitaltech

healthcare spending in the us is projected to have risen 75 in 2023 to 48 trillion federal data showed on wednesday outpacing the projected annual gross domestic product growth rate of 61

httpswwwreuterscombusinesshealthcarepharmaceuticalsushealthcarespendingrises48trillion2023outpacinggdp20240612httpswwwreuterscombusinesshealthcarepharmaceuticalsushealthcarespendingrises48trillion2023outpacinggdp20240612  aside from what others are saying china is also black market central they cant sell their drugs for more because everyone know how to get the generic from a pharma company to which they are a dime a dozen over there

case and point you can buy tirzeptide from china for about 060mg the max dose of mounjaro is 15mgwk a month supply at max dose is 60mg that 6mo in china all you have to do is mix in some water and inject the same thing here is 5001000

and thats for small quantities if you buy it in larger quantities price goes down even more and yes these are almost always fully tested and verified not some bathtub quality nonsense these are real pharma companies that make all sort of generic stuff they just dont care about rule of law unless its something china itself cares about but if its a foreign company being hurt the ccp doesnt care unless they are forced to care

so this is a case where the companies are forced to sell in china else they will lose any and all legal rights yes china does recognize the rights even if they dont enforce it but if these companies didnt sell in china then this would legitimize the generic brands and possibly allow them to sell legally overseas its a sticky wicket  a few bits
 there is the government reimbursement market but there is also self pay so you can get low pricing on the nrdl or for small volume high price drugs have people pay for it themselves
 pricing has been improving you still have long term negative pricing demand dynamics mandatory rebates etc but its driven by volume
 even at lower pricing thats still volume and noone sells at a loss 
 margins are probably less than a third of the us but most of the development costs are a sunk cost by the time you decide whether to put it on the market or not local companies who only run their clinical costs in china can make money from development costs big multinational companies launch because its just incremental profit at that point  a small margin on massive volumes is still a massive profit  because usa citizens are willing to pay 20x to 100x the break even price thus subsidize the drugs of the entire world  number 1 rule of business

sell for what people will pay not what its worth  lol some folks think people in asia will buy that shit for 3000 usd do you even know the average salary of asian countries

ever been to asia if you compare the situation on the street you would know  china have government negotiated price for most drugs because of the universal healthcare the price power of chinese government is incredible  china chinese pensions are usually below 5000 rmb  700 bucks is poor and a diabetic country on the march almost the same rate as us so this is strategic  why is nvo willing to sell drugs at such high price in us


there fixed the title for you  china has a very xx or f off attitude in this aspect  yes its the insurance companies demanding to pay so much for drugs  what can go wrong billionaires always look after average joe s  explanation is healthcare spending doesnt fix the main issues causing declined life expectancy in usa and other countries the biggest killers have causes requiring long term lifestyle and dietary changes healthcare system cant fix how people live

top cause of death is heart disease the fix isnt more medication and more money people know they need to exercise eat well and avoid drugs but they dont do it

then there is cancer lung cancer is the top cancer smoking is the main cause of lung cancer

others are stroke diabetes respiratory illness viral infections kidney disease

its the same thing dont do drugs exercise and eat properly

i would say the internet taking off caused a lot of the decline in physical activity  yeah spending went up because people are unhealthier and going to the hospital more  you think nvo is worth 3000  did they earn money billions by paycheck by paycheck or by stock buyers like us here who made them billionaires  nailed it",-0.2345,-0.9917,-1

Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"indias adani group saw shares of its companies plunge thursday after its billionaire chairman gautam adani was indicted in a new york federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation

the 62yearold billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over 250 million in bribes to indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than 2 billion in profits

the indian groups flagship firm adani enterprises fell 10 while the company in the eye of the storm adani green energy tanked 1728 adani energy fell 20 

adani power lost 1381 adani ports share price dropped 10 while the groups retail arm adani wilmar shed 787

the benchmark nse nifty 50 index slid 063 in its first hour of trade

adani along with two executives from adani green energy limited  his nephew sagar adani and vneet jaain  have been charged with misleading us and international investors about the companys adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over 3 billion to finance energy projects

the fivecount indictment in us district court in brooklyn also accused ranjit gupta and rupesh agarwal former executives of the renewable energy firm azure power global along with three former employees of the canadian institutional investor caisse de depot et placement du quebec  saurabh agarwal cyril cabanes and deepak malhotra

cdpq said it is aware of the charges filed those employees were all terminated in 2023 and cdpq is cooperating with us authorities the investor said in an email

this comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and brazen stock manipulation made by shortseller firm hindenburg research 

since releasing our january 2023 report identifying adani as the largest corporate con in history we have never wavered in our view nor has adani ever refuted our findings hindenburg said in a statement to cnbc on thursday

the conglomerate had rebutted the claims adding that it has always been in compliance with all laws

these charges do not change the strong underlying fundamentals of indias market or the countrys growth trajectory said raymond james head of advisory solutions and market strategy matt orton 

once the dust settles there will be even better opportunities for longterm investors in india he said

is he the richest person ever to be charged in the usa  he has to be up there  he is the elon musk of india without an iota of actual intelligence and innovation of course 

  
indias govt is beholden to him nothing will come of this  so hard to time these things i sold inda etf when price was at 40 after adani hindenburg report first came out sold for a loss now its 53 and even got as high as 59  adani time to flatter trump and youll be fine i think thats how it works   this goes out to the guy who questioned hindenburg researchs credibility because nothing came of the adani report in a thread about smci a while ago

 how you doing  not familiar with how the system works in us but can trump nix this investigation by directing the ag to withdraw the case  lol like there is an option b to get contracts in india bribing is the only way  now do elon  none of this is shocking for the way business is done in india this is a nothing burger  so what rahul gandhi has been saying for all this while is true

also its this a good time to buy adani shares or wait for some more development on this  he is just giving kenyaafrica headache trying to acquire their parastatals  forgot to bribe the sec lol  iski behen ka lauda aur maka bhosada  did he violate us law probably in a world of limited resources is this what the us government should spend money on probably not  they are way too massive to be affected by a state court outside india they have great historical power within the indian economy and political scene  is this the guy with the huge fat son that can hardly walk  well he didnt lie he said he would use it for the solar project lol  dude is literally sitting on the table with the pm of india and getting the access to so many public assets absolute scum of a human  of course he is putting 10 layers of grease at every level of government 

his company has been accused of exploiting mining contracts in australia and using the indian government to pressure australia to not make it a big deal   should have run for president instead  as if us lobbying is not bribery  deleted  nothing is going to happen anyone who does business knows thats its very common even us companies follow the same practices to win tenders btw in morning added adani port and its already up close to 10 of my buying price  they really dont one year later and theyre looking more and more spot on with each headline  roblox execs next  isnt the legal energy better invested on smci 


the chinese are literally sh1tting in the backyard and were chasing peanuts elsewhere  most of them will pivot to whataboutism and us hypocrisy guarantee it  im more looking towards the news media in india who kept sweeping adani related reports under the rug in the past couple of years they have an internationalsized egg on their faces now let the meltdown begin  same place as they were then india  because they lied to us and other international investors about it ie they didnt bribe government officials  us investors but give me a break this is exactly how most emerging and def india markets work bribe  corp operations  adani is main backer of current government which does not comply with uss foreign policy against russia

so us is punishing current govts main backer  they didnt get any  indias government didnt indict him the us government did  he is the elon musk of india without an iota of actual intelligence and innovation of course

so simply the elon musk of india  no one considers him as elon musk of india all he did is bribe to get contracts  i think he is more of manufacturing than tech  not a significant part of msci index therere literally 40 companies with bigger weight before this one comes in the list   deleted  hindenberg report is about shell companies

current accusation is about bribe

both are common practices in third world  he can if he wants to  yes this is a federal case so after trump takes over if the attorney general of trump matt gaetz if confirmed asks the ny us prosecutor to drop the case it will be done  knowing how close adani  modi and trump  modi are it will go something like    

modi to trump informally can you take care of it   
trump to gaetz informally take care of it   
gaetz to ny us prosecutor drop it  haha so true indias critical infrastructure is owned by mega corps and theyre call in bed with the govt to keep the influence its a joke that people look to this country as the next asian superpower when you see at the ground level its riddled with corruption neopotism and jingoism 

the media will sweep this under the rug just like they do with anything not proindia  well the sec and fbi if it gets to that will decide what type of a burger this is its not up to you or some other rando is it  agree this is the culture  no thats another guy  yeah he didnt lie though  this scum is responsible for massive investment in indian infrastructure  ports power plants roads real world things that india desperately needs what is surprising to me is that even such a connected and powerful industrialist is forced to pay bribes by goi bureaucrats  securities fraud is seriously disastrous in the us and this is beyond bribery actually adani isnt the only indian company doing bribery but it is the biggest securities fraud company out there that has to be taken down  i thought trump was racist  they should have used the word lobbying instead of bribing in their ppts all would have been fine  do tell  smci is not even chinese its a taiwanese american businessman who is using sketchy back channels in taiwan  he is the bank of the ruling party they are going to play the cards of nationalism international propaganda etc  hindenburg research has been releasing nonstop updates and they all point to media as well as regulators in india being implicitly complicit like they ignore the bad stuff not that they actively help

happy for every cent hindenburg research made off of adanis stocks  bro they are just gonna pivot to western conspiracy talking points  as an indian i can say i have a bridge to sell to anyone who believed that this is like believing logan paul when he says his next crypto coin is super duper legit  bribe in developing nations lobby in developed ones  yes but instead of a covert conversation with a wink and a nod this dumbo was making power point slides about the bribes  so we should just do nothing this is good  how did they establish that a bribe was paid wouldnt that require evidence of bribery that occurred in india  which does not comply with uss foreign policy against russia


india buying oil is in line with western interests  do you expect people to take you seriously if you say elon musk isnt intelligent   yes but large companies dont operate in a vacuum and negative sentiment in stocks for india sector can spread into panic for investors i had a similar thought back then oh its just one guy doesnt represent all of india economy etc etc but the news kept dropping the price

conversely perhaps if you still believe in india etf can buy the dips now if its irrational fear  adani targeted for backing the soontobe most powerful person in the world 

this line of thinking makes zero sense  the hindenburg report does include bribes on exports though


scandal 2 the investigative documents squarely accused adani enterprises of bribing all levels of government

the adani enterprises has paid the bribes for getting undue favour for illegal exports pg 55

the officials of port department customs police kspcb crz mines local politicians and others are involved in receiving the bribe money from ms adani enterprisesthe criminal cases under the prevention of corruption act should be filed against those who figured in the seized record of adani enterprises pg 54

based on documentation seized during the investigation justice santosh hegde said adani enterprises had paid bribes on a pership basis ranging from inr 50000 us 1100 at 2010 exchange rates to the port director at inr 5500 us 120 at the time and to individual port staff pg 52

justice hedge recommended that adani enterprises lease of the state governmentowned belekeri port be terminated and that the company be barred from any future government leases pg 55  time for adani to do another bribe  sounds like the previous uk government  youre describing most countries  being corrupt has nothing to do with being a super power  removed  bribing is like a mandatory shit in india lmao  hes innocent your honor it was just a simple misunderstanding  i thought trump was hitler  httpshindenburgresearchcomroblox  not bribes gifts lol   with the amount of deep research they conducted before coming out with that bombshell i say they deserve every penny they made and i hope they keep exposing even more of such predators duping genuine investors of their money  fix smci first thats a bigger fish  lol where can we get a copy of this pptx  httpsgifdbcomimageshighthewirestringerbellconspiracyjimhqn9opu75h416webphttpsgifdbcomimageshighthewirestringerbellconspiracyjimhqn9opu75h416webp  we need those links  theres long been a push by business groups to make paying bribes legal in foreign countries where its basically impossible to do business without it

large multinational us corporations are basically forced to quietly look the other way while the locals in those nations pay the bribes under the table a lot of the time  i dont disagree just stating the obvious  in a world of limited resources is this money the government needs to be spending going after some guy in india for going above and beyond for green energy  adani made a presentation with the bribes that they paid   all they have is smoke  mirrors waste of tax payers money

i am sure he bribed but federal inditing at the cost of tax payers money lol  meh so no new allegations then  im not black im oj  oj simpson  hell be excluded from us capital markets thats not a nothing burger especially if you are an investor  or the stock goes into a death spiral and they lose billions of dollars its already down 20  if a person doesnt bribe others he gets laugh at  even the pm of canada agrees what you need to know about the snclavalin affairhttpswwwcbccanewspoliticstrudeauwilsonraybouldattorneygeneralsnclavalin15014271

honestly how it should work is that if a country allows its officials to be bribed that country should be sanctioned and not allowed to export their goods to our country developed nations only go full sicko mode when russia starts invading ukraine but when developing countries are unable to fight corruption developed countries allow it to happen just look at some of these countries in africa who have a terrorism problem they need help from a militia but only russia is willing to supply a private army this is a great opportunity to actually use a military for good but instead us only likes to occupy afghanistan  lol too many big words bro above and beyond green energy lmao  this reads like a joke i hope this is not real  you got downvoted but thats unfortunately how indian bureaucracy works so much red tape that without bribes youd be stuck in bureaucratic hell",0.5264,0.9862,1
Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"10 introduction

etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in ecommerce and ill argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral

the idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmadevintage goods is amazing and theres no doubt that there is demand for it

any marketplace has two important metrics

 the gross merchandise value also known as gmv represents the value of all products sold through the website etsy decided to use gross merchandise sales gms which is just a different term
 the takerate represents their share of the gms

its gms increased from 4 billion in 2018 prior to the pandemic to 135 billion in 2021 however since then etsy has experienced a decline and the gms in 2023 was 132 billion the lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace

20 the real problem

the company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers and together they paint quite a picture

the number of active sellers continued to grow from 2021 to 2023 it increased from 75 million to 9 million

the number of buyers has been flat

economics101 teaches us a simple lesson if the demand is stable and there is an increase in supply the prices will decrease

economics also teaches that lower prices would attract more buyers increasing the demand

so where are the buyers

as etsy doesnt and cannot check the quality of all the products more and more aigenerated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market heres a comment from a reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development

dropshipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces i used to adore etsy when it first started but now its just absolute garbage you have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure its the real deal and actually handmade this recently happened to me when i was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group turned out it was a scam using a real artisans pictures to sell their cheap shit thankfully i was able to rectify the issue but it was a hustle

the us sellers used to contribute over 75 of etsys revenue a decade ago now its down to 50

ill argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm etsy in the long run with the events being

1 increase in lowvalue products on etsy
2 the lowvalue products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the highvalue products as they are cheaper
3 the sellers of highvalue products will sell fewer products and some of them will eventually leave etsy
4 the buyers will be disappointed by the lowvalue products and will not use etsy as much or at all

30 what is etsy doing

etsy is spending 30 of its revenue on marketing vs 20 a decade ago and has even engaged in tv ads to raise awareness and bring new customers

over the last few years the company has been spending 700800m per year only to keep the revenue flat it is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed and the strategy is to replace them with new ones

40 the takerate

the only other way for etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its takerate and its share of the gms

the company splits its revenue into two groups

 marketplace revenue 73 of total  these are required fees that cannot be avoided transaction fees payment processing fees listing fees
 service revenue 27 of total  these are optional such as onsite advertising shipping labels etc

its takerate is incredibly high at 21 double from a decade ago for comparison ebays take rate is 14

50 terrible management decisions

as the company was reaching its peak the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions

 reverb aug 15th 2019  a marketplace for new used and vintage music gear was acquired for 270 million
 elo 7 july 2nd 2021  also known as the etsy of brazil a brazilbased marketplace for unique handmade items was acquired for 212 million
 depop july 12th 2021  a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for 15 billion

it is important to note that depop had an annual revenue of 70 million no this is not a typo etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire depop

well not that long later in q32022 the company recorded impairment charges of over 1 billion for depop and elo7 no better way to destroy shareholders value quickly than by overpaying for an acquisition

a year later in q32023 elo7 was sold at a loss

60 historical financial performance

historically this is still an impressive growth its revenue grew from 200 million a decade ago to 28 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at 70

its operating margin is lingering around 12 now as both marketing  product development as  of revenue have been increasing the increase in marketing expense as  of revenue has already been highlighted in a previous section it is necessary to maintain the buyers base so potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general  administrative as  of revenue

70 valuation

the two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are

 revenue  given that the number of active buyers hasnt grown in the last few years it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation
 operating margin  i do think theres room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general  administrative as  of revenue my assumption is that that it will increase to 14 over time

based on my input the fair value of the company is 32 billion 29share this is significantly lower than the current market cap of 57 billion 51share

anyone betting on etsy is ultimately betting that

1 the number of lowvalue products will decrease over time
2 the number of buyers will start growing again
3 etsy can continue increasing its takerate without losing sellers of highvalue products
4 the management will not engage in acquisition as they are clearly bad at it

 i also know a woman that sell handmade stuff on etsy what she sells is cheap products that she spends 30 minutes using a cricut on to  embroider something on it at least its not made in a factory but every else she uses to make the product is its crap once i saw how the sausage was made so to speak i was even more out on etsy ",0.9928,-0.9319,1

my question is also how we define markets and market share what if a new product competes with a previous market and wins out to the point of replacing the old market with its new market ex landline phone  dumb cellphone  smartphone or horse and carriage gasoline car electricalhybrid cars",0.128,0.951,1

for the quarter ended october 31 palo alto networks reported adjusted earnings per share of 156 versus the consensus estimate of 147 revenue totaled 214b versus the estimate of 212b

for the quarter in progress palo alto networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from 154 to 156 with a midpoint that matches the estimate its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from 222b to 225b which represents 13 growth year over year the midpoint of 2235b comes in just above the estimate of 223b   

second quarter nextgeneration security arr is expected to range from 47b to 475b which would represent a yearoveryear increase of 20

total revenue for fiscal year 2025 which runs from august 2024 through july 2025 is expected to range from 912b to 917b this would represent 14 growth year over year 

our platformization progress continued in q1 driving strong financial results said dipak golechha chief financial officer of palo alto networks as a result we are raising our ngs arr revenue and nongaap eps guidance for the year

the board of directors also approved a twoforone stock split which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1b to 2b trading on a splitadjusted basis is expected to begin on dec 16 2024

ive been a big fan of panw for the last 2 years while the billings decline isnt great its been expected as the company pushes for platformization i anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook but short term may seem like growth is slowing platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because theyll be integrated across the business across multiple levels

although im a big fan of the stock i will admit its an expensive one a lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth i think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels im not in cybersecurity so im not sure the likelihood of that but id keep an eye on it ive made several posts about panw over the last year and my consensus is i will continue to buy monthly and if theres a large pull back down to 350 ill look to make a large purchase with cash reserves",RunningForIt,2024-11-21 19:25:26,38,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgtsd/palo_alto_networks_beats_q1_estimates_shares_fall/,,"i

who knew  so much gains and they do a dividend of 1 cent per share thats just insulting  exceptional  growth has slowed last several quarter in a row market might need to accept its beginning to peak  ive been long nvda for 11 years a preearnings surge followed by a postearnings dip is typical no matter how good the numbers are its not about some investors are disappointed or the numbers are good but not good enough its simply an established cycle that investors expect and therefore perpetuate  going to be hard to have huge beat when everything is sold out for next year  crazy  i wonder if the overheating issue with the blackwell might pop up sometime with all the new orders going out now thatchip better perform  well damn now that i know about that 001 dividend i wish id held shares instead of calls  nvda also sells to sovereign lotta countries in asia are buying  look at the trend in gross margins though if you want to know why the stock is down ah

last quarter gross margin was 7515 that was down from the prior quarter of 7835

this quarter gross margin was 746 which was down from 7515 next quarter guide for gross margin is 73  735

this is not a good trend and shows nvidia is loosing pricing power  and yet in the after hours market it keeps going steadily down i wonder if people see an ai wall coming up  first 120 and then maybe next quarter 180  options holders hosed love to see it  just trying to confirm is the conference call coming up at 5 oclock eastern time  you cant stop these guys  i will be buying more tomorrow  sylvia jablonski on bloomberg seriously just said she thinks nvidias share price can double in the next few years  why is it down aftermarket  i reckon wed be getting a lot of price target adjustments upward but that said a selloff into december after the weeks volatility clears for the stock reckon funds would jump on finance chief colette kress said blackwell shipments are scheduled to begin in the current quarter but warned that supply constraints will likely linger well into coming year  would be buy the dip moments for retails i guess  terrific story forecasted it years ago those that stuck with it are happy those that sold 2022 are still crying but now the grinding diminishing returns chart kicks in if amazons new upcoming chip even moderately impresses that is direct hole in nvidia earnings same for microsoft tesla will stick to nvda so data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in say 2026 or 2027 as next gen chips sales drop market saturation kicks in to level growth so i saw it easy to forecast 15 to 145 but 145 to 200 or 145 to 500 seems exponentially riskier to assume as a medium term target take amazon if amazon is happy with whatever chips it proposes even if nowhere near blackwell levels that drop in sales would hurt nvidia or just the news unless other ai consumers ping amazon for its chips they may very well replace amazon as a nvidia client on the other hand should nvda drop to 120s the pe becomes a too good to be true a steal either or i remain long on nvda but i no longer expect the terrific growth story i once had with tesla in 2020 or nvda to date  yeah and i sec i finally buy into they my call are worthless just my luck  great quarter yet the share has not moved up a bit 

i am afraid we are coming to the end of a bubble  i didnt know when will be its next split this stock is hot af  maximum revenue they can generate is 4550b per quarter then itll saturate current prices assume 100 yoy revenue growth for the next 10 yrs expecting revenue to be 350bquarter at some point unfortunately the world only needs so many data center chips  the beginning of the end 

remindme 3 months  excellent i expected good earnings i held and will look to reap the rewards in the years to come  reddit why no market cap double 7t  this company has a cheat code for shitting gold crazy profits  incredible numbers should do better with next administration all big tech should  deleted  rapidly slowing revenue growth qoq  then why isnt it fucking 200  until china invades taiwan and nvda becomes worthless overnight  sayonara puts  priced for better growth imo beating soft guidance  meh

0 missteps or craters until then  yolo  its joever  are my spy calls cooked tomorrow or no lol  deleted   this trend is unlikely to change in 2025

world war 3 has been pricedin  the hyperscalars are seeing their stocks struggle 

why keep spending so much capex when it just hurts your stocks  unlikely to change until 2027 as they are fully sold until there already id even say most likely until 2030  yes but the next quarters the growth yoy will be back to 20 still great but multiples should be adjusted accordingly  not necessarily if amazons new upcoming chip even moderately impresses that is direct hole in nvidia earnings same for microsoft tesla will stick to nvda so data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in say 2026 or 2027  and yet you still see comments in random threads of people saying ai has produced no results for companies people just putting their heads in the sand i guess and plenty more companies beyond nvidia utilizing ai have been posting higher earnings  not just the top dog  every single quarter  i glad about the lackluster response it allows me to get into some calls at a better entry price for the eventual spike up  uh that very much hasnt been the case outside of last quarter

im actually fairly sorry to be negative but at this point the performance of the entire semiconductor group is speaking for itself in a bad way the ai story is intact sure but the way semis are acting price wise says some of the winnings out of the oct 2023 major bottom are fixin to unwind in 2025  it isnt even sold off that much after hours  why does it feel like they are trying to shove ai up our asses and we dont really need it   jpow has you by the   thetagang sends their regards  ah the golden days of the kangaroo market  nvidia ai ironically was first used to make mic quality sound better during covid 

they dont trust it 100 to not mess up badly for their earnings calls though  yes and that is what concerns me great gp 70 great orders  all i fear is accounting irregularities as it is too fast and consistently over guidance  i hope not for the market but i worry  and then we have car company tesla eho barely makes finally some money and skyrocketed just after some promises d  and then we have car company tesla who barely makes finally some money and skyrocketed just after some promises d  its to get into mutual funds and etfs that require dividends  its only so dividend etfs can buy it  yeah not sure what i will spend my 10 cents this quarter on  its there so huang can buy a yacht in cash every quarter  its a governance hack  no lol flat  is the market chinese parents  market is greedy ugh  sort of crazy because the expected numbers were already stratospheric  guide was only 425m higher than expected  when youre priced to perfection above expectations doesnt cut it  the guide is light the beat was good  nah the beat was good unfortunately the guide is a bit light for bw coming up next quarter  extremely dependent on hyperscalars continuing to expand their capex even as their stocks struggle 

that data center number is insane i wonder what happens if one of the hyperscalars decide the demand is not growing as fast as their capex  brother nvidia is worth 357t  what are you expecting their current ttm revenue is 113b their current price is 31x their sales they are posting great numbers but the stock performance has been beyond exceptional the stock is down like 15 after hours thats not what disappointed looks like

this is why people lose money with stocks its not just about buying a good business its buying it at a good price  went from 1 trillion to nearly 4 trillion in a year what do you expect lol  not as bad as the previous quarter the fluctuation after hours are within the margin of noise as far as im concerned this is great exceeds expectations and no large sell off holding steady  when you look at the non earnings reaction literally what do you have to even talk about

stop playing options then no one cares about short term price movement  i mean the way semiconductors have traded as a group since july is beginning to speak loudly here folks 

i would not be expecting much next year for the market to continue its going to need to find another sector to lean on but the most likely case is that semis are too connected now and a bit of an unwind instead of flattish is going to be packing some serious punch  people expect nvda to do well the stock is down because of this and is likely not a market catalyst  or at least a 5 drop wont bring the entire market with it  did they provide guidelines for growth that can make up for that  nvidia is a startup so there are no reasons to give dividends  insulting for who theyre treating me very well as a shareholder  its for etf inclusion not shareholder returns  blackwell is coming 2025  you just have to accept you missed the boat at this price its just way to risky with growth slowing  its been a hell of a ride but the train is slowing  lol ive seen this one before and its wrong


fy24q4 earn 221 guide 240 
q1 earn 26b guide 28b realized 18 expected 95
q2 earn 30b guide 325b realized 16 expected 7
q3 earn 351b guide 375b realized 17 expected 8  except thats not true  a post earnings dip was true last quarter but not really before that  agreed supply constraints also mean they cannot really beat as much nvidia signs long contracts so pricing doesnt rise in supply crunch   going to be hard to have huge beat when everything is sold out for next year

well its not going to happen with that attitude  overheating is a non story very easy issue to solve  does it show nvidia losing to other ai chips or nvidia squeezing up the price of leading edge fab capacity  those are two very different scenarios  250 is nothing wouldnt surprise me if its green tomorrow  yes  you cant stop nvda but the price of the stock for sure can be stopped its overinflated  i think a lot of people will  ive been long nvda for 11 years this happens a lot no matter how strong the results the story is still intact so dont sell  its not down much its within the margin of noise imo  i will be messaging you in 3 months on 20250220 221831 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202502202022183120utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1gvzyehnvidia_earnings_beat_across_the_board_strongly5tt1ncontext3

  why is the next administration buying the gpus  lol beats across the board is good to me people sell on the the news id be surprised if its not up by friday close  its really not this is the average growth this year  i think the slight down trend after market means that expectations are slightly ahead of what we see but not by much the delta between the two is getting smaller 2 is noise imo  can you say where power considerations or hurdles  time to buy some more dlr reit stock then  because they want to be properly positioned for the future current stock price is irrelevant if ai becomes the only way to run a business and grow 

we simply do not know yet  because in the case of msft they cant handle the insane demand for the product  huh how are their stocks struggling meta is up 60 on the year google up 25 amazon up 35 microsoft is lagging but still up 10 

weird comment 

they need to spend so they dont become the next intel once a great company that stopped innovating to reduce cost and focus on short term profits but got killed long term  because they dont care about short term fluctuations in their stock and are doing what they believe is best for the business long term  because their stock is going to hurt a lot more of theyre last past the post on the race for ai  its like clockwork at this point gotta love that volatility  unlike humans the algos responsible for most trades dont tend to make money by not actively trading the almost instant lurches arent fun to watch in real time at least when the beat and raise doesnt beat the rng whisper number

i tend to look at revenue growth which i was expected to be linear sequentially because it has been statistically linear and this time it was above that previous highr2 bestfit line im happy with it vehicle revenue growth which they clarified was related to ai not infotainment was accelerating  why is it intact when theres been no roi  ai is about more than generating cat photos or cleaning up emails  demand is outpacing supply thats why data centers cant buy enough of these  not permitted under the law  uhh niagara falls  halls

fa la la la la la la la la la  my back very much against the wall  balls  yeah i wouldnt mind if it would stop running and stay in a fair value range for some time then any market correction could make it a good entry point also for new investors if it keeps running then theres the shadow of a massive drop all the time behind the corner  ar growing at an insane rate vs revs is literally the same red flag people caught with enron lol

this filing looks mad sus if insider selling ramps up in the next 2 months this could get ugly  elon sends out a press release about fsd and trump  stock surges  it aint fuckin right  we are a vibesbased economy  to paraphrase an article tesla is a bet on corruption paying off  that actually makes a lot of sense still seems rather insultingly low matters not to me too deep in bubble territory for my tastes now  this was insightful it makes me respect nvdas understanding of business even more appreciate you spreading info  actually it is from when they ipoed at 1 and that was a good dividend then  seeing this now appreciate the response  best comment lol  deleted  theyre fucked if amazon or google decide to cut down on capex there will be a point where they have enough shovels to dig and will need no more  yea thats the breaking point right the f there  they switch to a cheaper alternative  ifwhen nvidia misses earnings it will be a blood bath  i love the rational responses like this one thank you  so few understand this reality is even if ai transforms the world it doesnt mean the stocl keeps going up  most of us bought nvda years ago  99 of people who buy stocks dont know what market cap is and have no concept of valuations you are wasting your breath  in fact they are actually underperforming profit is up 94 yy while the shares are up like 190 

there is a lot of future growth being baked in right now  ttm is a fairly useless metric at the best of times and a completely useless metric when a company is growing like nvidia is revenue literally up 100 percent yoy  i think youre misunderstanding my point its not whether its down right now the guidance and the beat were significant enough that the news can act as a positive catalyst for the entire market going forward had the news been bad or just really good coupled with general market sentiment that seems to have turned sour this week i feared for the worst  lets hope honestly nvda will be at 160 by end of year i just want to shake off these last few days and get the momentum back  sure but its still insulting  the valuation is what really makes investing in nvda now way too risky its at nearly a 36 price to sales ratio right now which is utterly insane with how expensive it is  the hell are you coming at me for im just stating what the data says  not slowing but slowing acceleration  last year nvidia went up 208 this year ytd its up 202 its hardly slowing  youre using guidance deltas and not pure rates  ive been in this position many times in 11 years awesome earnings but dip anyway  yeah wtf if it goes down 10 then i think it fair to say but fuck until 10 its just a tiny drop  thanks  come back in 2044  thats why a lot of people lose money buying at inflated value because they dont even consider valuation  lower corporate taxes  this year is only 3 quarters  deleted  thats exactly my thoughts even if ai doesnt pay off in a huge way the risk of being left behind is too great google meta microsoft amazon can all easily afford for this not to pay off but none of them can afford to miss out  seems risky to put all chips in one bet  whats it do

definitely doesnt fix their mic quality  not permitted under the law  mommy  i really think about are all the orders correctly booked  yes they have been in business a long time but with explosive growth come new hires  high work pressure leading to short cuts  i seen it too many times   this filing looks mad sus

in what way  a bet against america  bubble territory lol keep sitting on the sidelines even though it really isnt all that late to print with nvidia  i also chuckled at the dividend but having it as a low cost entry cost for other opportunities seems wise for a company both established and growing  it was 11b more last quarter 

22b in q1 

then 3b in that one crazy quarter end 2023  seems like were there or almost there with the benefits of scaling appearing to plateau there just isnt enough training data out there to justify building out more and more compute ad infinitum eventually the field will have to transition away from bruteforcing through raw compute to figuring out how to squeeze the most juice out of the data orange  deleted  just like the internet  technically it does if it provides a fundamental economic input like labour  ie digital labour replacing human labour  actually it kinda does  im not disagreeing that the guidance and beat werent significant i just dont see nvda being a market catalyst anymore when people expect them to beat i do think this market will continue to go up until mid january for many reasons just dont believe nvda is a catalyst  that might be tough given endless headlines about unqualified knuckledraggers being appointed to key govt positions i realize a lot of americans want to tear shit down and start over but the market doesnt like it much  lol pretty sure he meant you as in people in general not you specifically  i wasnt coming at you i mean investors buying up here are taking on a lot of risk i have no position i accepted i missed the boat on this stock i believe like you said its near peak  q1 2023 was the bottom of the 2022 downcycle  deleted  yes that was typically the case preai boom i do remember that but the sell off on earnings has only been a recent thing  oh wow that should completely change adoption of ai  vancouver  build as in construction which part of the data center that you handle  peoria

loved my visits to toronto when i lived in michigan  cls   literally zero logic to this comment  they are not the hyperscalers are making more money than they know what to do with so instead of massive buybacks or acquisitions  they build data centers 

10 years ago these same companies used to spend 10s of billions buying up smaller companies and fringe ideas hoping to hit the next thing now they are investing in themselves by building the data centers having a massive data center that has practical use is less risk for shareholders than spending billions on shady startups that go nowhere 

nvidia is just there to sell all the shovels in a gold rush  they have enough cash to not care where else are they going to spend their profits  for sure but it could be riskier to fall behind  ill bite  i work in financial regulation  ai has been transformative in the last 12 months with communication surveillance systems  the major providers are lining up to buy as much nvda hardware as they can get their hands on in the range of 9 figures each

those providers without bleedingedge ai solutions just produce much shittier realworld results and are not signing new deals  in this industry ai works it produces realworld results that give realworld roi for brokerdealers who upgrade their monitoring packages to aienabled ones  fewer review staff fewer false positives more defensible compliance posture with the regulatory bodies and reduced risk of fines for not meeting monitoring requirements  those fines can be dozens to hundreds of millions for failure to monitor regulated employees sufficiently and they are handed out on the regular

financial communication monitoring like this is just one of the many many industries people dont even know exists and its pumping money into nvidias pockets as fast as jensen can produce chips for them  just in this market sector there are other groups of providers pouring money into ai to monitor retail transactions directly for aml and sanctions violations  yet another group of companies are gobbling up ai for their direct trade surveillance offerings

there you have 3 entire segments of industry that few laypeople have even heard of all of which are spending hand over fist on nvdas chips and all of whom have positive roi on that investment because its just so damn good at what it does

so yes the dude above you is 100 right that the ai running on your computer is just the left over jokes and toys of whats happening with the real heavy lifting at the industrial level  google it  for my insurance by manulife i can chat with their ai that has read and understood my coverage contract and ask it questions instead of taking an hour on the phone to speak to a rep manulife reduced wait time by 15 last quarter  it will transition to inference which is where amd beats nvda  most of the compute will be used at inference time thats the growth story by the end of the year every person with a device will be using ai hundreds of times a day there is no end to the need for compute  dude q2 2025 is when they will be ramping up blackwell and are going to do 4050b in quarterly revenue youd be gambling shorting then  that would be a really bad idea  i love how people compare ai to the internet the usefulness of the internet is widely different from this ai hype llm are just a glorified search engine using user data  you might be right im just saying that the market feels like its running on fumes right now and will take any bit of good news what do you think about the direction from here to the end of the year  i think the market is in a little bit of a denial phase right now i dont think the crazy will get priced in until mid january before the inauguration  i read it as referring specifically to usnowcups0  im pretty sure nearly everyone was aware that you meant you as in people in general  i dont see how beats matter their guidance delta is becoming smaller they arent going to keep beating the same rate when the delta gets smaller  you agreed and disagreed in one sentence  were talking about how the numbers can be bigger taxes is a huge factor  deleted  deleted  how so the ceo of google also practically said the same thing the consequences of underspending are simply worse than the consequences of overspending trivial logic 

are you an intel bagholder by any chance because they underspent on their foundries years ago now look at them trying to catch up  their stocks are struggling because fcf is plummeting the capex data center arms race has only one winner  maybe but what if the ai bubble pops and then you can buy cheaper why not spread out more spend  financial communication monitoring

does this mean monitoring bankers emails to each other or like visa transactions  remindme 6 months  there is more to ai than chatbots its applications are being used in tons of industries for help in rd surveillance monitoring data logistics finance healthcare etc 

chatbots are just the lazy leftovers of this tech for quick widespread adoption but the real tech is being used much more effectively in nearly every industry  exactly the internet is massively more important than ai for a multitude of reasons  lol no  tell pharma that willya  problem with the english language  dropbox or tiktok  lol im just curious about data center construction and interested to know which other industries or infrastructure aside from the server parts and components suppliers that may benefit from this boom electrical cooling switches tiles etc  well yes all that fcf is going to nvidia and other chip companies but their idea is that this investment is going to increase their fcf in the long run  and what if there is no bubble and this technology continues to advance and become part of our daily lives this could only be the start of significant gains if the technology continues to improve and find more use cases of widespread adoption 

i feel like people screaming bubble are the same people who would have said the beginning stages of mobile phone technology in the late 90searly 2000s was our peak and the bubble will surely pop any second nowadays cell phones are inherently crucial pieces of tech everyone needs for daily life which wasnt the case when it first got off the ground  lol ai bubble what bubble thats like saying what if railways go under  exactly they should be like blockbuster and wait for netflix to figure out all the expensive streaming infrastructure logistics then swoop in when bandwidth got cheaper  for these systems its traders communications  with anyone and by any method  visa transactions are a very different type of monitoring but ai is being used heavily there as well  remindme 6 months  strange how they all hyped up at the same time huh  ok ill be the doofus whats fcf  wheres nokia and blackberry now  not sure if this was sarcasm but if not the analogy is a bit on the nose railways did go through a massive bubble during the industrial revolution httpsenmwikipediaorgwikirailway_mania  if compare to jp and cn it does  free cash flow  if you use chatgpt you wouldnt have to ask such an embarrassing question in a stock trading sub  you are right but the company selling the railway steel didnt go under thats what nvidia is doing  is that a question  your inventiveness is exceeded only by my lack of embarrassment on this occasion

but thanks  i will actually take that on board and spare you and others some future secondhand embarrassment",0.765,0.9999,1
Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"let me preface this by saying i live in europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to us markets due to higher historical returns

this in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the spnasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in europe so do any american guys look at european markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the eu markets 

theres an argument to be made that potentially investing into eu serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to us markets but i find it very hard to find good european companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity slower growth more regulation and government oversight 

personally the three companies i still have in my portfolio in the eu markets is rr nvo and lvmh lvmh is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to china additionally nvo is listed on nyse and had uptil recently performed rather well

so finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the american markets for european ones or actively increasing their allocation if so would love to know the rationale and more importantly any particular industries or geographies that youre targeting ",Ok_Criticism_558,2024-11-21 19:31:42,29,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/,,"no 100 us

rationale being i like money  there are some specific things that are interesting lvmh some other oddsends but i wouldnt be buying europe broadly  no the eu is over regulated to the point where it negatively impacts companies ability to compete  a lot of pharmaceutical companies are doing badly right now including nvo and azn other interesting stocks include asml i guess  only asml  im german and the only german stocks id consider would be rheinmetall 108 1y and sap 61  bought a ton of lvmh last week 

ive done very well on my european stock picks the last few years such as adyey after it plummeted   as im told a large percentage of us retail traders dont even have access to european markets that obviously doesnt help either  im holding around half of my nongambling portfolio in european titles


 25 big pharma novartis and roche

low revenue growth but solid 20 profit margin  34 dividend yield 
megatrend ageing population

 15 in ubs

up 60 in 2 years got credit suisse assets for a bargain us expansion targeted half of their dividend is repayment of capital so its taxfree

 8 in airbus because fuck boeing  i have almost 90 invested in us only but ironically my foreign companies are performing the best rru and tsmeven tho listed on ndq

i think there are good high growth stocks available in europe right now besides obvious rru there are enx isp su asml sap that are on my watchlists 

but i dont think i would invest in broader european market or single country only stock picking  i love european companies many are multi national corporations with deflated valuations due to regional bias imo 

i am also a total contrarian on germany i am very bullish on germany as i think they stand to benefit from consistent cheap us natural gas due to the rising us fracking gors and midstream capacity improvement unlike what the narrative is in germany i think that their trade and overall relationship further integrates rather than splinters with the us under the new us administration im particularly interested in german auto manufacturers at the moment  bank of georgia is trading cheaply and growing 15 yoy  europe is a misunderstood market imo there are some great companies that would do better if listed in the us but i would say the continent offers less downside and volatility than the us would you rather go up 40 one year then 30 then 20 then go down 26 and then 23 or the european return cycle of maybe averaging 15 a year but going down 34 in a bad year  europe is dying dont risk your money  switched to us markets due to higher historical returns

not necessarily

httpstopforeignstockscomwpcontentuploads201904singlecountryequitymarketreturnsdevelopedworld1999to2018png

imo everyone should invest globally and not be heavily concentrated in any single nation  yeah i looked at them then i looked back at the us  hard to find any good opportunities as europe is lagging the us in anything growth related in a dramatic fashion the political climate is nonsense what used to be the leading country once germany has turned into a burden of policies and rules that go nowhere their choice on nuclear energy explains that well i am sure that a skilled investor would be able to find some gems but for the time and risk that it would take you for doing that id rather look at the us market  i do so simply because i dont have to deal with forex but theres definitely less opportunities  i saw something about fielmann group on x but i need to look more closely at it could be something  no  i am a huge ag1 bull which is germany based european carvana  whats point investing in europe companies us has more companies better returns historically and more liquidity  other than ferrari hell no  the only one i have currently is zeal networks tima and it has done pretty well over the year or so that i have owned itits up like 25 percent and pays a decent dividend i dont really know if it is a good investment now though after it has had a good run i also chose it specifically because it seemed to fit with the current economic downturn in europe esp germany as their main business is running lotteries  i own a number of eu stocks they are much more attractively valued than us ones 

bti bud basfy rhhby

unfortunately they dont perform like us stocks but the dividends are nice maybe theyll pick up once the ukrainian thing is over maybe they wont they were cheap  personal fav high quality names in europe are asml rmspa  sgnwa  own nvo and i am sure i own more or parts of it  however the total market traded is small compare to other asian or middle east funds  these etfs are losing steam lately india was my favorite  porsche dhl german stocks look really undervalued  no  i like rheinmetall but i havent bought yet  respectfully never had any interest in investing in europe and probably never will the open immigration policies are not good for stock returns  plain and simple  i like the esin etf some quality european companies that are at least able to follow the sp500s returns for a bit

being long usa and underweight everything else is in style now i dont know when it will reverse but for the same amount of cash flow youll pay a hefty premium to hold us stocks vs stocks pretty much anywhere else  declining populations regulations that cripple businesses high taxes unsustainable cradle to grave entitlements massive brain drain and american isolationism forcing europe to actually pay for the defense of europe a new american administration imposing tariffs and  will demand europe opens it markets and end their protectionist policies only a complete moron would invest in europe outside of a few select companies  no i dont like eu regulations you never know what theyre going to ban or make illegal next id be more inclined to invest in the heavily manipulated chinese markets since at least i might catch a wild swing   maybe in 20278 the united states is moving into protectionism since europe is our largest trading partner the current administration is looking to take more give less it means american companies are more likely to be the outperformers and youre going to see reduced earnings potential in europe as a whole im sure there will be some companies that outperform but trying to figure out which ones and why its too early to even attempt what it is doing is setting up one hell of a good buying opportunity just not yet pes likely to get lower all else equal if we get a democrat elected in 2028 i would be all over the european trade  volkswagen is at sale  eu sucks from a business perspective maybe asml but why not just go with tsm anyway

i dont own it but i regret not getting into spotify  usa markets are a million miles ahead from other markets the 2nd best is india  i am not as well traveled as some but ive spent quite a bit of time in a number of european countries and deal with europeans regularly at work

no work ethic no innovation insane regulatory hurdles no avenues for entrepreneurs to get started and most of their countries are essentially theme parks for americans and asians  theyre a collective group of people who are so soft that they dont care that a war of territorial aggression is happening on their doorstep 

id bet against europe in favor of america and southeast asia in every way that i could  europoor 

no thank you  us private equity eating up european stocks but american retail investors think cocacola and costco are going to make them millionaires  please keep saying this so i have more time to scoop up cheap european stocks  out of curiosity what are some of your other specific things that are interesting besides luxury  people always say this here but like what specific regulations do you take issue with every time i see something about an eu regulation it always seems reasonable and understandable  laughs in kog easily my top earner  asml is a very solid play and seems particularly attractive after recent crash think its a very strong long term hold just waiting till when the bleeding stops since its flirting with the 600 buck mark recently  you can buy adrs are most every broker 

you can buy over the counter european stocks on fidelity i do it all the time  really does robinhood schwab and others not offer european stocks seems like quite a big miss  love your non gambling portfolio lots of blue chip stocks and completely missed the benefit ubs would get for taking over cs for peanuts

roche could be interesting especially with their expected entry into glp  ive followed a similar strategy of investing into specific stocks eschewing any indexes which is weird since most americans invest directly into major us indexes and do well generally

which is clearly not the winning strategy for europe with all major indexes lagging their us counterparts  i have a love hate relationship with vw everytime i look at it thinking damn seems at a very attractive price point only to realise itll look even more attractive the week after  ehh europes economy is mature and  stagnant in my view

higher dividend yields much less growth and volatility than us growth industries like tech just isnt nearly as aggressive or well represented

ive kept diversified overseas positions for safety for a long time including euro zone europe def tends to underperform for overall appreciation especially after you factor in dividend witholding taxes with countries like france and switzerland

i largely view it as as a mitigation for risks of us markets which is bulk of my portfolio imploding or selfdestructing very low expectations of outperformance in a bull market  maybe i am stupid but these might be the worst charts ive ever seen  very interesting chart would never in 10 guesses have picked denmark new zealand and australia as the top 3 best performing markets for last 2 decades  correction open broken immigration policies phd scholars cannot get a visa but arrive on a boat and you get a free house and a monthly salary i am all for humanitarian aid but they really need to fix policy loopholes around this thing

not sure why the world thinks europe is open ask any american trying to get work visa in europe  how does having open immigration policy have a negative impact on stock returns  we do have an immigration problem but of all the issues this is not one that hugely affects stock returns  yep just feels wrong to be completely all in into one single market never heard of esin they seem to be beating the sp last year def worth digging further thanks  what did they ban or make illegal last time  dont you think europe will countertariff the us as well its not a one way street its not like the us just tariffs the global market out of competing in the us and then nothing happens to us exports  i am not as well traveled as some

to the surprise of no one  i mean they are cheap for a reason its not like you discovered infinite money glitch 

sadly im saying that as european i wish our markets were as strong as american but thats the way things are unless we find a way to unite the economies and languages of all eu countries well stay weak and divided the risk aversion and fiscal austerity dont help either  sometimes things are cheap for a reason  thats like saying youd rather have a bunch of beaters instead of a ferrari  more time theyve been cheap for 100 years and rightly so  evolution is something ive pondered société des bains de mer as a potential buyhold that is probably not going to be a home run but is an interesting company with fantastic assets that few have ever heard of asml exor is a kindasortamaybe  i am waiting for the day when eu can say fu to us about any sanctions sale bans tarrifs which us randomly decides to slap on foreign companies this one asml httpswwwgooglecomfinancequoteasmlnasdaqwindow1ya heavyweight in eurostoxx index is down because it cannot sell to china as per us orders 

also waiting for the day when people can open a bank account in europe without filling a form about us stuff its quite funny that a korean person or take any nationality  residence must fill fatca forms to open a bank account in europe why is this scheme not reciprocal not advocating any taz evasion but i dont know a single other example where a foreign country mandates a blanket rule on the financial system worldwide

also waiting for a day when a european smallmidcapunder 1b can grow to become 100b in five years the environment is far too communist or sabotagey here no sizeable vc support to speak of and from what i can see its all centuryold old wealth ruling the business climate 

until then its sp500 and nasdaq100 for me youve an exposure to all markets automatically because these companies operate globally  saab makes the things that make american weapons go boom  unrelated to investing but the do you want to accept cookies makes everyones life worse i get the intention but its the worst implementation i could envision im proeu but often it seems like they arrogantly want to collect rent checks on american innovation  communism seemed reasonable and understandable to the people that supported it too until they found out they were starving to death  of course they do whoever is saying they dont is incorrect  european companies dont like listing in america because of the extra expense and the extra regulation  im guessing the reason for rh would be that payment for order flow is illegal at least in my country  8 in airbus because fuck boeing

hell yeah brother  yea havent been able to pull the trigger on vw i like bmw the most of the group   definitely better ways to visualise the data but the annualised returns at the bottom is fairly intuitive imo  excellent distinction americans consider europe open because they seemingly take no action in stopping the illegal immigration  it doesnt he is just pushing rightwing talking points  im german and experience this on a daily basis and it is often discussed in the german finance subreddits it has an impact like this there are more and more people who rely on welfare bürgergeld and you have an increasing amount of people who arent german immigrants who get bürgergeld in order to pay the bürgergeld you need taxes germany already has extremely high taxes taxes will be increased in the next year again people who earn a lot are fed up with this they wander off to other countries like the us so are a lot of companies  you could write a 1000 page dissertation on proscons of immigration but in general the govt has to spend money to provide services on people pooruneducated people are net receivers receive more benefits than they pay in taxes this draws money out of the government that could be used to elsewhere like subsidies on semiconductors like here in the us  theyre all interrelated on a super simple basis  more immigrants  larger govt needed  stricter regulation of domestic companies someone has to pay for all the social programs overcrowding also drags down the school systems leading to less innovation  esin is just a newer etf but it replicates the msci europe industrials 2035 capped index which is way older its done a lot better than most other european stock indices past decade and is centered around what europe has done best indsutrials

good luck  oh im sure they will but they also have more to lose so either way in that situation its still not the place to be i would want to buy europe into an acceleration which were likely to get with the next democrat or even when it looks like the next democrat is coming that could come potentially as early as the midterms in 2026 europe and 2025 its just not exciting maybe when we see some technical bottoming patterns you could begin to look but theres so much heat in all of these assets going up thats where the money is chasing bitcoin is closing in on 100k tech has reset in fact there is one european company i own now that you mention it asml after that correction this is a pretty good price that company is very unique though no one can do what they do without them all the american companies like nvidia even intel amd qualcomm all that stuff doesnt exist  its not like you discovered infinite money glitch

i didnt 

oh well back betting on horse races  our markets arent strong

novo nordisk was already a world leader when obesity started in the 2000s before the us and if paid attention could have made you a lot of money no us firm comes close asml and so many others 

european markets offer so many more structured products a wider variety of stocks the ability to invest in the us china and the middle east  ferraris are made in 


europe   you dont know what youre talking about  
  
germany was the top performing developed market in 2003 2006 and 2012  germany outperformed the us in those years 

same for switzerland in 2000

in 2017 the us was outperformed by the netherlands france germany switzerland and the uk  never knew about this monaco company that has basically provided sp like returns over the past 5 years seems like growth over past few quarters has slowed down though do you see that changing in the future  the thing is there is an ever increasing amount of vc support but the best european companies still at late stage prefer to scale to the us due to higher valuations spotify is the prime example founded in sweden but founder took the business to the us at the first opportunity and listed in nyse so even the best and brightest european tech companies want to leave their domestic markets and enter us with european vcs encouraging this due to better scope of returns

there just arent as many buyers willing to pay a premium for the best companies in europe to the extent that the us investors and markets can not sure if this is to do with us having higher risk appetite or easier access to capital to scale faster  asml acquired an american company to help develop euv part of the sale agreement included export controls because it was considered sensitive technology  but europe still has some of the highest living standards on earth  slovenia is on track to overtake the us in hdi next year lol  at least robinhood does not as per their own website which apparently you arent allowed to link to

thats what half of reddit already  mercedes benz mbgde can be a 3x trade story if the stars align and the sentiment keeps positive ive been monitoring to confirm a bullish reversal  youre way behind if you think thats still right wing talk take a look at rcanada  thinking the immigration in europe is out of hand is rightwinglol even the left acknowledged this by now what are you then  i understand the problems of immigration im just saying that it doesnt hugely affect stock returns like other issues do why not talk about the crazy prices of energy 3x the price of the us and china for electricity and 5x for gas this plays a huge factor because in the end everything is energy the fact that the business climate is getting worse and worse in europe from really heavy regulations to really high taxes all talent is leaving europe because high income and wealth taxes where china and the us give companies money to reduce carbon eu fines companies that dont people in europe work less every year were the least working countries in the world where the average workweek is way lower than the us or china while at the same time we have way more vacation i mean i can keep going on about strict climate policies uncertain political movements to lack of investments in rd but the point is there are a lot of issues that have way more impact than immigration  im not so sure on that the us losing its biggest trading partner and vice versa doesnt bode well for any party involved to be honest i dont think it will happen i think well see some random tariffs on european steel and luxury goods and then the eu will issue some countertariffs on that the us and eu are way too intertwined economically for a trade war to do any party any good what so ever 

eu needs us tech us needs european advanced industrial technology asml is just one example of many european companies who provide industrial services and technology to global corporations the us included only other real competitor in this space is japan highend steel used in automotive applications and as tool steel for all types of industry molds and dies come from mainly european companies or japanese companies industrial robotics mainly come from swedishswiss german or japanese companies germany is huge in the chemical industry germany is huge in the industrial optics industry sweden where i am from is big in the general engineering industry and mining industry with the likes of volvo group worlds largest semitruck company skf worlds largest advanced bearing company atlas copco general engineering and sandvik mining and industry tooling  and there are many more examples 

i am not saying the us cant function without europe or vice versa like some people are but i am saying that we are way too interconnected to have stupid tradewars weighing us down in an already unstable world we are our most important allies and the one thing russiachina and the others want more than anything is for us to stop being such good friends why should we give them this there arent many things more stupid in geopolitics than infighting between the eu and the us 

well well i guess my rant has been more about actual economics and geopolitics than the stock market deep down we all know the stock market is not as grounded in national and international economics as some people think it is the stock market is more interested in profits and dividends whereas our actual economies benefit more from job creation than it does from pure profits 

just providing a different perspective on this whole thing the stock market isnt as representative of actual economics as some people think  so on which horses are you betting  no no they are not lol  too bad shitty investments and economies are made there too  those are single points in time and dont mean much if anything

do this

germany vs the us from 2000present

switzerland vs the us from 2000present  cool ill keep my 40 annualised gains in mag 7 thanks enjoy being poor though  bro its 2b maket cap with daily volume of 386 shares gifemotefree_emotes_packdizzy_face just saying before you yolo on this one therere also hilton and marriots  i can see a path for higher growth but i think for me thats a really an instance of something that i see as a buy put away and forget about name with some crown jewel assets including the famed casino de monte carlo httpswwwmontecarlosbmcomencasinomonacocasinomontecarlo

  also it has a tiny float of around 3m shares last i checked the government of monaco owns more than half the shares and theres a number of other investors  lvmh owns around 5 too for example

never knew about this monaco company 

yeah its something ive rarely ever seen mentioned someones long article on the stock from 2022  httpswwwundervaluedsharescomweeklydispatchesbainsmermonacoasurprisecoupformonacoscasinocompany  i just looked up european stocks on robinhood and i can buy shares of them right now  porsche  immigration levels are way higher in the us and canada so if it has anything to do with stocks following your logic it should be good for stocks  rcanada is a right wing subreddit you didnt seriously just say that lol  it is a rightwing talking point what has nothing to do with stocks so go to a political sub to spew it  those issues  especially energy  would be more priced in  where would the money flow in either situation lets say it goes bad lots of tariffs and a trade war its not good for either economy but its especially bad for europe 

lets say it goes less bad and its a trade negotiation its great for america and still a little bit bad for europe 

there are trillions of dollars out there and they arent going to be parking it in india so its either equities bonds of various countries but bonds are less attractive when inflation is still a concern if we went into a demand destruction deflationary environment bonds would probably work pretty well especially american treasuries but thats the thing the money has to go somewhere and pretty much at every juncture theres no real argument to choose europe over america because in any one of these scenarios they are going to do less good specific companies like asml are different because they have an edge they are not replaceable if some of these european companies start to build more factories in america and play along its still going to hurt their profitability in the short run and that might be your buying opportunity in anticipation of democrats getting back in office its a long play though  the cheap ones  mag 7 which i also own with slowing growth meanwhile i got 100 gains in 612 months in european small cap construction and mining there are levels to this game  they are called europoors for a reason lmao  uk  us immigration rates are actually nearly identical germanys is significantly the highest 

western immigrants are generally wealthier and more educated compared to europeans usa specifically also spends much less per citizen on social programs less draining on the system  i have a hard time believing that right wing compared to the rest of reddit thats middle maybe  a trade war occurs and if your richest cant go on european holidays anymore without paying 2000 visas  us tariffs disappear that same evening  i get what you are talking about you are talking about financial markets and the us financial power and i 100 agree with you that the us is the world leader in financial markets and a lot of equity bonds and other securities investments go to the us because of that 

what i am talking about is economics did you know that the eu exports 400bn yearly to the us while the us exports only 230bn to the eu 

a tariff situation would be horrible for both parties because

1 the eu makes a lot of money from exporting to the us and obviously does not want to lose that losing too much of that would be deflationary as demand would drop significantly and no one wants deflation 

2 the us obviously needs a lot of what its buying from the eu and making it more expensive is going to drive up the cost to the end consumer contributing to inflation in the process 

did you know that the us imports of european goods is almost as large as its imports of chinese goods 400bn vs 500bn despite what you hear in the us with stuff like oh we buy everything from china we are so dependent on china and so on you are almost just as dependent on the eu the difference is it is products you as and end consumer do not see as much they are mostly in the industries that produce your goods

its almost as if we live in a global economy where trade happens between everyone which is also largely the reason why we can have such diverse and successful economies  where countries who do not have a certain natural resource can buy it from another country in order to manufacture something that some other country wants and so on japans economy is a perfect example of this 

the us pioneered the modern global economy and now it threatens to leave it it is absurd to me again the absurdity of this is why again my guess is that we will not see this actually happening it would hurt both parties and i think the only tariffs that will come out of this is ones issued because of emotional sake a look i did what i said i would type of thing but thats just my guess 

anyway it seems like we are interested in talking about two different things so i guess we wont get that much further with this conversation  germany is place 53 on cia factbook us 38 united kingdom 39 biggest group of immigrants in europe are western imigrants from eastern europe  you can believe what you want makes no difference to me but its quite right wing  isnt the goal to position yourself to make money

"Target shares plunge 20% after discounter cuts forecast, posts biggest earnings miss in two years","targethttpswwwcnbccomquotestgt on wednesday missed wall streets quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and posted only a slight uptick in customer traffic despite the discounters price cuts on thousands of items and its early holiday sale 

the bigbox retailer reversed course and cut its fullyear profit guidance just three months after hiking that forecasthttpswwwcnbccom20240821targettgtq22024earningshtm it said it expects fullyear adjusted earnings per share to range from 830 to 890 thats lower than the 9 to 970 per share rangehttpswwwcnbccom20240821targettgtq22024earningshtml that it shared in august and below the 955 a share expected by analysts according to streetaccount

target now expects fourthquarter comparable sales to be approximately flat that metric which is also known as samestore sales includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months 

target fell short of wall streets earnings per share estimate by 20 its biggest miss in two years it also marked its first revenue miss since august 2023 

the companys shares plunged 20 in morning trading",SFkitty94122,2024-11-20 20:27:41,652,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvrcw8/target_shares_plunge_20_after_discounter_cuts/,,"20 is kind of wild for a company like target its also wild to hike guidance in the previous quarter and then downgrade the next it will be interesting to see how the holiday numbers end up for a lot of these retail stores

on a side note it seems like everywhere i go in person now a days theres no staff or i have a lot trouble finding people if i need help seems like target is always empty with no cashiers went to barnes and noble two days ago and spent 20 minutes trying to find a book because i couldnt find someone to help me feels like its easier to just order shit off amazon instead of going in person to these stores and waste an hour of my time  combining this with the walmart earnings report it looks like consumers are pulling back spending not a great start to the holiday season 

well get costco earnings on 1212 so at least some mid holiday season info

edit amazon earnings in january would be interesting to see if theyre getting a boost given the low prices and time saving  i just bought at 122 i still see my wife making a lot of purchases at target my wifes buying trends has never failed me before  target has always baffled me as a consumer its sits in a space that makes no sense its trying to sell cheap stuff at slightly higher prices by pretending its slightly better than stuff you find at walmart amazon or anywhere else but the reality is its the same stuff

i think the key to target has always been convenience i need something today and if target is closer than walmart they win because 1 saving isnt worth it but thats it if walmart is closer then they win if i can wait a day then amazon wins

on top of that they dont have a unique item to draw me in a loss leader if you will when they expanded the food court i thought that they were doing just that but they totally half ared the food court what a missed opportunity that was

their hot dogs suck the other food pizza hut crap is overpriced and not fresh i mean if you want me to bring my kids for a bite to eat and then have me shop there you need to do a lot better this is how costco does it i go there far more often because of the stupid food court gas and 5 chicken i save 2 just to go on and spend 200 inside target already has the infrastructure to do it just up your quality discount the hot food and draw people in how do you mess this up people will naturally buy other things while there for convenience  anecdotal but i was in a store in west san jose recently and the underwearsocks were locked up in security cases and 3 employees i talked to didnt speak a word of english hard to differentiate yourself from walmart when youre like this  nice little discount on a good stock  part of the problem has to be that target seems unable to manage its supply chain to keep its shelves stocked its like winning the lottery of i actually find 1 milk in stock went shopping last saturday afternoon and the yogurt shelves were mostly empty i dont know why target cant keep groceries in stock  its almost like target were able to pretend that organized theft rings were responsible for falling sales for only so long  

when the likes of costco and walmart are doing well if not stealing your customers for 2 consecutive years you have a problem  wow sounds like they really missed their targets  targets near me are terrible especially in terms of customer service a lot of fucking items including soap toothpaste and laundry detergent is locked up in a glass case and no one shows up when you ring the damn bell its so bad that i started going to walmart which was surprisingly better  man i love target too much better vibes and atmosphere then walmart so this is kind of disappointing but i mean things are expensive

edit why did walmart have more success then target though  target has been going downhill for years i get kmart vibes when i go in there  when are people going to realize that tgt is mismanaged has a product mix that is inconsistent with todays consumer has no new ideas for turnaround and seems to be hell bent to follow the kmart plan to irrelevance
investors outta be picketing hq and demanding real top down changes
im sorry for the employees who are overworked and shortstaffed  holy moly its mega down  how is wmt doing so well and tgt is stumbling isnt tgt supposed to cater to a more affluent customer base  walmart doing great because it has become a one point stop for folks even with high incomes the point of high income is preservation of capital target was sent packing from canada when their stores were empty or limited staff and canadians whom value time and daylight kicked it out we can do costco wmt costco  wmt wmt  loblaws or just wmt but target always forced you to go somewhere else losing especially time  is this an early recession indicator  did you know that tj maxx is twice the market cap of target it just shows you how poorly tgt has done for its shareholders maybe this is a wakeup call but i doubt it  dropping my 02 here my target and walmart are on different sides of the same street ive started going to walmart more when i know what i want since they have a dozen working self checkout stations the target on the other hand since covid has had only 4 self checkouts with 1 of them broken almost every time and a line to use those self checkouts and then they only have one person actually operating a register

not sure if other people have had this experience but the gamble of having to wait 20 minutes for self checkout versus zero wait at walmart has swayed me more than any other factor  they only have themselves to blame the last few times ive gone there for something specific theyve been out of it plus theyve been locking up more and more product rather than driving to target for something i need only to leave empty handed or getting annoyed that i have to wait for someone to unlock a display case ive just started ordering those items from amazon

since i usually picked up a couple other random impulse items during my target runs thats even more money that theyre losing  they went from training threeletter agencies to locking tide and bleach behind access points while reducing total staff

why the fuck did i not short them   hot take inflation rearing its head finally

im wondering if walmart is the winner here bc of perceived low cost obvi walmart had nice earnings wonder whats behind the juxtaposition  thanks i hate it been holding since the last 20 bloodbath in 2022 i lost a lot of money back then and it looks like things havent improved at all  
  
for as long as i can remember the dominance of amazon and walmart has been a shadow hanging over targets head nobody gave it a chance in the era of ecommerce and wrote it off as the next sears despite all odds it found a way to survive even thrive thats why i held on for so long because i assumed they would figure it out like they always had

im not sure if they can do it anymore management is terrible at their jobs and blames everything but themselves for poor performance their main advantage over walmart the shopping experience is completely countered by walmart where do they go from here  target has so many challenges what should be even more alarming is that last year they were hit with terrible foot traffic reduction because of the boycott  and also safety concerns in stores  the fact that q2 underperformed im sure was shocking internally when discretionary spending took a back burner to essentials they lost ground to walmart walmart is a literal one stop shop target is fun but is not a grocery store for most americans and walmart has gained ground with more affluent shoppers which ironically target has abandoned those people in hopes to bring in a value guest but their focus on value is so dramatic  and its only rooted in poorly constructed private label its almost as if theyve eliminated a lot of mainstream brands in lieu of their own i think theyve lost their way and no longer have an identity and walmart is making genuine strides in technology supply chain and infrastructure while target seems to be a step behind i think theyre going to need a leader change sooner than later to get back on track  im guessing walmart is eating into their customer base honestly feels like walmart has improved closer to targets quality if not better but retain lower prices  time to buy low  im surprised to not see this mentioned but maybe a year ago or more target redesigned their online business to include thirdparty sellers so when you search their app for something a bunch of bullshit results get returned you can filter it out to see only stuff sold by target but its annoying and makes the experience really terrible when i do find what im looking for thats sold and shipped by target its more expensive than amazon also where i live buying stuff spontaneously at target sucks because the prices on the website are cheaper they will price match at the register but its pain and i hate wondering if im overpaying for stuff in store i just buy stuff on amazon and walmart now every once in awhile target will have a crazy sale on something but thats the extend of what i buy there now  walmart had a huge beat could targets issues be specific to target i know they shot themselves in the foot wading into social issues could we still be seeing some of that could corporate governance be at fault  this is wild i wonder whats going on inside the company  target is basically a more expensive cleaner kmart walmart still has them absolutely demolished in terms of volume pricing and inventory variety some even compete on cleanliness new ones for the first 510 years after that they tend to look like kmarts during bankruptcy  they went from training threeletter agencies to locking tide and bleach behind access points while reducing total staff

why did i not short them   target is for people who either 1 are rich 2 think theyre rich 3 not careful with money even though they know theyre not rich or 4 dont feel like being in the vicinity of typical walmart shoppers

kind of an interesting niche for retail but they have customers  20 is an insane knee jerk reaction and i would be very surprised if it doesnt recoup at least half what it lost today in the next couple weeks  damn i am using target instead of bendtheknee bezoss amazon they have s lot of the same stuff  ship it right to you  target fucked up going curbside and actively driving people out of the stores it fucked up actively preventing people from wandering from impulse buying and from having the happy mental connection of going to target there is a reason costco dont fuck around with curbside target abandoned its store to chase low margins with zero upside you go into stores no and it is just a sad red walmart no variety nothing to look at no effort no inspiration or attempt to make me wander and shop empty aisles and shelves i have zero reason to chose target over walmart now when before there was an illusion of more upscale experience at a comparable price  inventory up 30 on sales flat what are they doing going to put lots of pressure on margin in coming quarters  i think i should invest  price gouging chickens come home to roost  who goes into a target their online store is prehistoric  they are no longer relevant target had class when people started to use walmart instead of kmart for jokes  now what do they have lame commercials  im so glad i read sams book stopped me from buying target stock  target is sears and the armpit of macys mixed together  target has no moat and doesnt really specialize in anything probably time for cost cutting to remain competitive  never understood the comparison between target and walmart apple and oranges  deleted  uh oh  looks like the higher interest rates are finally shrinking spending and affecting profits  i bet more people will put christmas on their credit card  visa might be a good buy here  i almost always think this is just a way to buy at a cheaper price that they manipulated  sold it post election  that worked out 20 gain    balances out also selling disney at the same time  thats ironic  as a canadian i could tell you folks walked in out canadian store and made a grimace this is good  in 2015 at 0 interest rates target closed all 133 stores and canadians are atrociously bad financial planners but value one thing time due to climate shorter daylight hours in winter so having to wait in a target to pay x more was a no no for  but time far worst or not finding what you want and be compelled to detour by walmart so if canadians whom are not good with money actually outvoted target in 2015 that should signal why americans will do the same in 2024 and they are far savvier with   target is a discounter huh  i think the bigger issue is that walmart has really ramp up their online sales to a point where it is now respectable in this regard target is slipping big time  might not be a bad time to buy some leaps  i always thought of target and walmart as a reflection of the actual economy could mean a huge drop in spending and mark of a beginning of a recession  i used to shop at target so i dont have to go into walmart but now walmart offers walmart plus so i dont mind using them if shit is being delivered i am buying from the vendor at the lowest price box of crayons from walmart or target makes no difference to me  what bothers me about the last few visits to target is how hard it is to find simple basic items everything has been over designed over styled and over priced i wanted an empty spray bottle the closest thing i could find was a a weird 15 cleaning system which had a spray bottle and some other stuff i didnt need they used to sell packages of multiple  sponge make up wedges for 23  the only ones i could locate were singlelarge and 6 that looked like they were styled for instagram i see less of familiar national brands or targets discount versions and way more boutique brands i love nice design and pretty things but i cant afford to pay extra on every day consumables just to feel fancy  target has the only low sugar grape jelly but i dont like putting my groceries up on their returns counter rather than a conveyor belt like they used have twenty years ago well they still have them but only staff one of them if youre lucky  since when is target a discounter they always sell shit at full price even walmart is not a discounter  family tree or family dollar are  black friday sale came early not picking up target on clear over reaction is obvious mistake  is buying target stock a value buy or stay away  target  i cant imagine buying target stock  its not 2004  they lock everything up now in the stores and sell woke clothing  also curbside pushes people out of the store  the miss on earnings and lowered guidance definitely caught investors off guard itll be interesting to see how they adjust for the rest of the year  picked up 10k worth this morning give it some time itll bounce back  i only go there for the occasional grocery item most of the stuff in target like their cloths are crap and their furniture it ultra low grade particle board shit  wow so my wife shopping at target for 5 hours didnt help them lol  ughh its the poor people stealing shit thats why we cant meet our forecasted numbers s  i love and prefer target the clientele is better the lines are better the store is smaller

im a buyer at 121

i also support their lgbtqia  apparel  what you gonna do when tiktok shop comes for you 

tgt dump  what was the amount of shares shorted last quarter and this quartersomeone made money  well its been pretty overvalued for a while and pricing in many of the same growth metrics other onlineers and comparables  its a goddamned retailer  maybe stop locking up all the products and closing self checkout i just use amazon more now  did pelosis husband sell off their target shares yesterday  ppl are priming stuff to their house as they drive by target regularly  and the majority of that store comes from china i want to make some witty comment about their future but its not really coming to me   bought 100 shares at 12136 then sold at 12140

  
i have no problem with their politics but sadly i think this affects their sales not worth the risk in my mind with trump presidency could be a war on target brewing  target stores are giant shitholes

 messy isles 
 shelves in disarray
 understaffed  poor customer service
 everything seemingly under lock  key
 exorbitant pricing 
 minimal checkouts available

the stock deserves to get hammered this ceo has been getting away with mismanaging the brand for way too long  removed  dollar general for the win i despise target for their crap covid policies their pro theft policies and they can reap what they sow  yeah customer service feels like it was put on life support 10 years ago and covid killed it vicious cycle of companies not being able to pay well and offer low prices so more stuff moving online which kills jobs and rinse and repeat

 i still find good deals when im in smaller cities but in the major city i live amazon is almost always cheaper than our local target because nobody will work there for less than 20 hr which is fair because thats what you need to survive  customer service is in the toilet i appreciate places like costco for actually being fully staffed i went to michaels for the first time in a year no cashiers all self checkout but there was not a single attendant like every other store wont be going back target is hit or miss usually mine is well staffed but random days they have like nobody working and lines are halfway through the store  when i hear about people being mad at inflation honestly target is what comes to mind it really seems like they have just rounded up prices to the nearest ten regardless of product deodorant 10 for a stick shampoo 20  pretty nasty feedback loop staff is cut because people buy online more instore customers start buying online because of a lack of customer service  re your first comment the 20 drop makes more sense with that shifting guidance narrative makes it seem like leadership isnt quite sure what they are doing  tgt csuite needs to be fired  all of them  these clowns do this shit every few quarters  they have no clue whats going on at their stores  its time to clean house  every 3qrts they dp this shit and the stock drops 20 percent points  its pathetic  i took so much hate for saying target executives cant be trusted

previouly they pretended supply chain was why they had shitty corporate performance  

next debacle they blamed on weather

then they had a good run of covering up their incompetence with lies about shoplifting  this deceit was interesting because unlike vague claims on weather and supply there were facts that could objectively show how dishonest they were being

facts like the shrink values were not that huge and that the real losses were because of terrible executive strategy on product mix and inventory mismanagement  facts like how they presented shrink as if it meant only shoplifting when in fact shoplifting was only a small component of shrink and that much bigger components were their terrrible operational leadership enabling tons of friendly fraud and inventory mismanagement plus bad executive decisions on packaging and shipping and storage  

its facts like how all their excuses blaming shoplifting were trumpeted loudly by their pr department which isnt under oath and isnt subject to sec prosecution while they were judiciously restrained in using that false excuse in the mandatory filings for which they could be prosecuted or sanction for misrepresentation

its facts like how peers such as walmart have thrived as target has flopped even though they have the same markets the same customers the same business model

target has also distinguished themselves with poor people management

targets executives cant be trusted  yeah they basically feel like walmarts nowadays  i work at target not going to say which one so let me explain why it appears theres no staff because there isnt any one store out in the middle of nowhere proved it could operate on a skeleton crew so corporate took that to mean all stores could operate on a skeleton crew so they slashed everyones hours and only have the bare minimum number of staff at any given point true story they dont have more than 2 cashiers because they fully expect everyone else in the store to just drop what theyre doing and run to the registers if the line gets long you have trouble finding people when you need help because theres only 2 of us in the hardlines section of the store and were both in the back room trying get our pulls items in the back that need to go to the floor to a certain percentage by the end of the night or we get in big trouble corporate sees the percentage so when we dont hit it they know but when a disgruntled customer has a bad experience that usually only goes as far as local management who cares more about what corporate thinks than your experience which is something we can struggle to do if were constantly having to run out to the sales floor to help people and is made worse by the fact that they send the electronics person home around 6 meaning we also have to cover the electronics section something none of us are trained for which means that when someone asks for help it really disrupts our work and can potentially screw us over for the night which is also why when you do find someone to help you they are often not as helpful as youd like and id like to point out its not even a matter of not enough profits we can see how much money our store makes every day we make significantly more in 1 day than it would take to give every employee 40 hours a week and not every employee wants 40 hours sure there are costs we arent seeing but i seriously doubt that their profit margins are so narrow that they cant up the hours and properly staff the store  same can be said about raleys safeway best buy all skeleton crews layoffs minimal hours slow sales its all coming to a head probably lets see what more tariffs in 2025 bring  how do you manage to fuck up guidance this badly

these are not serious people  now that target has everything i ever need locked behind glass or in cages and its impossible to find someone to open anything i usually avoid going there  for what its worth i went to walmart to pick up spme meds and they are back to fullystaffed checkouts probably 12 open registers i noticed  i was in target twice this past week 5 days apart i saw two halffull drink containers on a shelf the first time they hadnt moved an inch when i came back  our target is in kinda a ghetto area but its filthy and never has any cashiers or lanes open if i wanted that shopping experience id save 5 and hit up walmart  my target has like 4 self check lanes and 20 cashier lanes and only staff 1 of them they gotta pick what they want to do either staff them or get more fucking self check because waiting 15 minutes for either is insane  i literally spend hundreds of dollars a month on amazon just so i dont have to go into a store  complete opposite of a place like sephora  i went to the bay area and few weeks ago and i needed a toothbrush and some deodorant so i went to walgreens never again everything is locked behind glass even the the 2 toothbrush i got good luck if you need more than one thing because one guy was running around the entire store opening the glass for people to get stuff i get why people order from amazon soo much idk if its similar in walmart or target but i can only oy imagine  what does this say about the rest of the economy  haha youre just realizing in 2024 that amazon has taken over retail because its easier and cheaper  they get scheduled by a stupid algorithm  i went yesterday to buy a new phone charger at walmart of course it was locked up and i had to wait 10 mins before an employee hurriedly walked by when i got his attention i could see his eyes roll to the back of his head that i caught him the entire time he was checking me out i could feel his utter contempt barely disguised  im looking forward to some great black friday sales  costco executives have traditionally been amazingly candid on industry realities telling truths that we never ever hear elsewhere

i listen to then to get the real truth on transportation costs and trends same with commodities and consumers

its little known but costco isnt actually a grocery business  its a subscription business model

as a result costco does costplus model for groceries  so if beef is up 15 at costco then i know for a fact thats a true reflection of beef inflation not corporate gouging at work  costco executives will often say eggs will be up 8 this quarter but supply is already back on stream and will be lower next q  i thought the walmart earnings beat  ive been spending more of my money at costco as i prepare for potential inflation due to tariffs and mass deportations my thinking is that i might as well stock up on household items that will last for awhile and costco is the best place to do that   combining this with the walmart earnings report it looks like consumers are pulling back spending not a great start to the holiday season  

it was when targets hand got forced and we witnessed them doing multiple rounds of price cuts on top of folks who work in liquidation reporting that target was dumping their unsold inventory onto them you knew inflation was falling fast and you knew that target whining about retail theft was just them blowing smoke up our asses when walmart themselves reported they were gaining higher networth customers ie targets prime base we didnt need to wait for the next cpi report to realize what was going on  

turns out walmart and costco managed inflationary pressures and pivoted in raising and then lowering prices masterfully  as a high income consumer who has walmart costco and target equidistant to my house i strongly feel its because target sucks 


there is no reason to go to target when walmart and costco have better selection and prices this is a target problem not a consumer problem  they offer no value over their competitors i dont even know why youd go to target other than if youre afraid of mingling with the more diverse racial and economic clientele at walmart and costco targets only selling point is it costs more so it keeps out the poors which doesnt seem like a very good business model  didnt target announce recently theyre cutting prices on a ton of items maybe they finally realized their inflated profits off raising prices can only last so long before people just abandon the store for good  cisco is always so god damned packed every time i go lines waiting to get chicken shoulder to shoulder walking outside of aisles its a mad house when i go to the huge target by my house theres never any cashier lines open and only one half of the self checkouts open never busy  idk where you live but yesterday afternoon i counted 15 workers in my target outside of the check out my target is always packed with workers and spectrum people trying to sell me phones  its the ecommerce and last mile delivery walmart is killing it on that front  costco will be interesting spending can be pulled back collectively but a lot of consumers just switch buying habits or locations cost sensitivity might drive people through the door at a costco rather than hurt it you still need gas 150 hot dogs and toilet paper  arw they pulling back or shifting to temu and shein  she have any other buying trends  lol true mine too target sephora lulu all still viable buys  my wife shops at  target as her hobby looks like millennial women couldnt save it  buddy smart money left target decades ago its now in costco and amazon  as someone who used to work at target corporate i can tell you personally that their leadership and culture is straight ass and they have no idea how to position the company  unique well they went all in on trans and dei in front of the store bold move thats paying off one way or the other  if you hold up a trump sign and they frown with disgust you will probably see an unstaffed store in a few months time

edit really you guys dont like satires about future trump policies i mean you voted trump to deport them didnt you  underrated comment  how is it a good stock its a poorly run company  not american but its probably the worst shop ive ever been in in my life  our small city size target stores are terrible with inventory i have a friend who jokes about writing his own app to post inventory checks on popular items like tp during his morning runs  this has become incredibly frustrating for me i very rarely go to target and am able to buy everything on my shopping list at least one of the things i want is almost always out of stock  sometimes there are problems with the supply chain but at least at my store we have so many pallets of product that just sits in the backroom literally everywhere in the backroom because we dont have the space to put it anywhere or the staff to properly deal with it thats why sometimes if you see online that it says we have a specific item the employee will still tell you were out of stock its very likely buried in an unbroken pallet somewhere in the backroom and finding it and digging it out would take a lot of time which we dont have because weve got 1000 other things to do before the end of our shift i will say that sometimes the system is wrong and we genuinely dont have the item but very often we absolutely have it but digging it out could easily take 2030 minutes you dont want to wait that long and i dont have 2030 minutes to spare breaking open and digging through dozens of pallets  this is hilarious my target is always packed with food but most people o know dont shop there cause of prices especially when aldis is next store  its the shoplifters theyre stealing all the yogurt

edit guess it wasnt clear s  i cant see to find vanilla almond milk anywhere  yeah my town has a walmart and target across the street from each other target has a little bit of some things while walmart has a lot of everything

we did have two other grocery stores in town and the one i would go to recently closed so the one remaining is a clusterfuck target and walmart both have food sections but target is super limited while walmart has full produce meat bakery and as many shelves of food as youd expect a typical grocery store  i just go there now because walmart will also have literally anything else i may need while target probably will but also probably wont

now idk if this is the case with all targets but the ones ive seen are just smaller little more expensive and less product versions of walmart the only convenience is its usually way less busier and more organized  mine installed those locked cabinets in like half the store beginning of the year was such a pain in the ass not sure if a directive or just store manager but they just leave them open lately probably not enough staff to respond to all the help buttons  nobody is smash and grabbing at costco but your point still remains with walmart doing well  idk man i still think theft is bad    and no one shows up when you ring the damn bell

because there very likely isnt anyone to show up targets all work on skeleton crews nowadays  i dont get why thats surprising walmart always has better and more selection of products target is for people who are trying to pretend that theyre better than they are its always been weird to me give me the store with more products and options any day  i think people care more about their wallets than vibes and atmosphere    edit why did walmart have more success then target though  

inflation which favored the company with better pricing power walmarts supply chain management is god tier and private label brands walmart was much much earlier to the game with private label brands like great value and even though sams club isnt as dominant as costco just having that store around during covid years was a case of right place right time costco and sams club taught us that if you can convince enough people to pay an annual membership fee and arm twist your suppliers into providing bulk discounts you can dominate during inflationary periods  walmart is where most americans get their groceries and since they are already there they will just buy stuff also thats what i heard on the radio 2 days ago  honestly the vibes at target are no longer good ive been a loyal customer of theirs for something like 15 years the stores now are a shell of what they were 5 years ago stuff is out of stock the place is super messy and disorganized so many clothes on the floor the vibe sucks and i go a lot less  walmart has succeeded in moving upscale a little the clientele are much different than 2 years ago theyve also stepped up the quality of their basic clothes  

at the same time ive noticed target has cut staff and their basic clothes like t shirts and flannels have turned to shit the one near me is a ghost town they dont seem to clean it either reminds me of a sears  target in the small city near me feels like a place that cater to middle class white people buying stuff they dont really need terrible grocery experience overpriced hygiene products small automotive and tool sections shoe sections filled with shoes that would have been popular 10 years ago 

its a place where wives go to spend their husbands money on random house trinkets and drink starbucks and maybe pick up the snacks for the kids while youre there 

the walmarts have trouble too but its  image based like the stereotype how trashy the people shop there and higher class people shop at target and how bad the they butchered the 247 and self checkouts 

target has better service and cleanliness at the expense of less things and higher prices 

walmart has worse service but more things and they are usually cheaper  yeah after it went up 80 in the last year  walmart is a one stop shop that provides great value for all brands the one stop shop is important  when grocery and essentials have been prioritized over discretionary purchases so walmart is benefiting from that however target was reliant on discretionary who also happened to have essentials and some grocery walmart wins and now target is making bad decisions to try and rush to the bottom abandoning their core consumer i think theyve lost their way  target is middle class

costco is upper class

walmart is working class

middle class is the hardest to market to and most picky  when times are good they swing to affluent when times are bad they swing to working class  economy seems to be on the way down per us consumer  didnt walmart just beat earnings tbh i dont follow this sector  all the businesses with retail or are themselves retail that are locking merchandise up seem to not be doing well target cvs walgreens  dude it used to be the complete opposite i used to not wanna go to walmart cuz thered be 2 registers and 3 self checkouts going even in the weekday youd have to wait a bit

that said i have been super bull walmart ever since i saw
that back a few years ago have about 275shares and some calls might pick up target today tho this is quite low  a lot of people are broke its anecdotal but i have friends who used to stick their nose up at walmart and would shop more at target and grocers like publix shift over the lower cost stores like walmart aldi and costco for bulk are seeing heavier foot traffic then ever  you dont have to wonder they literally post their same store sales growth monthly  5 bacon at target  excellent description target seems to have no idea what theyre doing  walmart has been stepping it up even sams club is really good i prefer it over costco now  im going with no due to looming inflation and people viewing target as more of a luxury store over walmart i actually sold a good chunk of my target shares thankfully the other day because i saw it dropping over the next year  buy low sell lower  potentially may be a play here  hell yeah this is a great opportunity i bet people in 3 years will be like what the hell was i doing not buying  yep  yolo on it with options


sadly my european broker who is riding is too high on moral horse concerned about its clients financial well being has banned options on tgt today what an ahole  they dipped to the low 100s last year around october 23 which was a good buying opportunity  im now in the red on my tgt holdings but im planning on dcaing some shares  they are also now close to a 4 yield  the women that shop at target look better than the women that shop at walmart

 target  target is one of the first stores i shop at for an event thar i need an outfit fast their prices r great and its pretty adorable their wicked merch is all im living in right now they need to either get rid of their grocery section or expand it  they have one major advantage over walmart they operate in cities  i returned to a store a quarter of a century later and it was different  picked up 10k worth at 127 per share so far not looking good    i didnt even know target had a woke reputation  theres always one person who feels the need to tell others about their political views lol literally nobody cares buddy   go woke up go broke

the phrase that keeps being repeated even though it has 0 predictive power

also slight uptick in customer traffic and 860 profit per share doesnt sound like going broke at all  correlation does not imply causation  i work there and have seen a lot of maga followers shopping on a daily basis its not wokeness that is killing the company its mismanagement lack of understanding at the corporate level on what goes on at the store level extreme understaffing and higher price points in which a lot of other stores can undercut them to have such a dramatic drop even during the holiday season is a worrying sign to say the least however it is not because of the orange cult leader  i can guarantee you people are not avoiding target because its too woke my maga relatives are not above going to target lol  which kills jobs

idk where people got this idea buying stuff online still requires jobs theyre just different jobs  its not covid that did this  so if i walk into palmetto state armory im paying top dollar for any gun i purchase any gun 

if i go online and order the same gun and wait a few weeks im getting a deeply discounted gun and usually a rebate to send off to the manufacturer 

its now turned into whether or not you want it right now or you can wait for it to be shipped from any retailer patience in buying saves you a lot of money  that is alright everything is gonna change under trump because he will bring back jobs to the usa i m sure customer service will be greater than ever before i mean who doesnt like working in factories for 12 hours and taking home 1100month  you dont need 20 an hour to survive

americans just have an expensive lifestyle lmao 


halting new home development not funding affordable housing complexes and all these ridiculous taxes on home building supplies make life even harder  not to mention at stores like target from the moment you walk in until ythe moment you walk out you are being video recorded scrutinized llms analyze various biomarkers or behavioral markers for anomalies these stores essentially have fbi teams investigating your every move to make sure you dont steal 

fuck target  target michaels and joann fabrics all feel like theyre juuuuuust this side of collapsing joanns is definitely the closest though its a little worse and a little less staffed every time i go in  yup i used to assume buying in person would be cheaper than amazon because they arent shipping right to me but nope the local target by me is usually 1020 more expensive for most household things compared to amazon  the thing that kills me with target is items in the store occasionally cost more sometimes significantly more than if you ordered the same goddamned items for driveup from the same exact store driveup requires employees to collect and process your order store it and bring it out to your car why is that consumer paying less than one who does their own shopping uses selfcheckout and bags it themselves

employees will adjust the price to the one in the app upon request but why should you have to scan each item with your phone to check the price to make sure you arent getting screwed  its been many years since i compared but when i initially started setting up subscriptions to items i would traditionally buy at target detergent toothpaste deodorant paper towels etc everything was already cheaper on amazon and with the amount of subscriptions i have i am always getting the extra 15 off too

i am genuinely surprised target hasnt launched a subscription service like walmart yet if prime raises their price again i am going to seriously look at switching to walmart because i dont really buy other things on amazon like i used to   leadership isnt quite sure what they are doing

in a report heard this morning cnbc it was reported that tgt overstocked in prep for the port strike that didnt happen and the storage costs exceeded savings  when are people going to realize that tgt is mismanaged has a product mix that is inconsistent with todays consumer has no new ideas for turnaround and seems to be hell bent to follow the kmart plan to irrelevance
investors outta be picketing hq and demanding real top down changes
im sorry for the employees who are overworked and shortstaffed  the theft one specifically in harlem is hilarious because they said they had to close the old one down in east harlem because because they had so much theft


but them they just opened a new one on 125 street which has pretty much the same customers   what you are saying is that target haw cut employee expenses about as far as they fan in order to transfer as much profit to corporate as possible  
   
meanwhile they post now hiring signs at various stores knowing full well they do not intend to actually hire anyone 

all of which impacts both the shopper and employee experience   
  
maybe a 20 drop isnt enough   they sound like they are running on a knifes edge  the need for never ending growth by cutting necessary expenses im seeing this at my company too   ive been shopping at heb  fully staffed all registers manned incredibly pleasant experience and they are making money hand over fist    same with costco   
   
sounds like the idea of slashing employees isnt the right one  i cant with walmart even when they are staffed which i cannot remember seeing they have the worst employees of any store or restaurant nobody ever smiles or even really acknowledges your question miserable place to shop  not true in our super center 1 2 registers open one for cigs and rest is self checkout   last time i went to walmart i texted my wife long line and then checked the time when i finally checked out  it took 27 minutes  thats prob because of retail theft is high in your area  idk about you dude but i like to leave my house and go outside  do you have any links for these types of interviews with costco execs where they talk shop and such all i can find are interview questions for careers at costco lol  walmart did beat my opinion is that walmart is seen as low costvalue chain 

target is not seen like that and frankly in store prices reflect that on non essential goods noted in the article they cut prices on essentials and saw growth in those areas 

also noted in walmarts earnings is that more high earners are shopping there to me this indicates the self fulfilling portion of a recession consumers anticipate worse economic conditions and therefor cut spending to preemptively ready themselves

ie higher income shoppers are trading in target items for walmart items in anticipation of an economic downturn  target shoppers go to walmart when they are worried about the economy and their paychecks  youll see literally no impact in 2025 
maybe by 2026 but thatll just mix together with broader economic trends with have existed for decades  did you do this in january 2021 as well  the same administration that promised a border wall mass deportations and a plethora of other failed promises this time is different right  im agree with this assessment  target is the middle child who doesnt know who he wants to be  

hes not super cheap like walmart not exclusive membership like costco not cheap online like amazon  you go to cisco hq to buy routers and switches lol just joking  target went from being nicer than walmart overall to being walmart with slightly nicer homegoods  i wish cisco gave me chicken all i get is the same crappy blue console cable i already have 100 of  just burn your money at that point cause anything from shein collapses in a couple of months  lol no  23andme

im holding bags please and thank you   we need an index tracking ujackfruitcrazy51 s wife habits  i can tell you what she doesnt buy lululemon  to some people comparing a company with a 12 pe ratio to a 55 matters also if youre looking at amazon as a retail play you need to do a little more research  my wife is always there must be good  you never want to run out of tp when you have the morning runs  lmaoooo  yeah buying groceries from target just feels icky to me super limited and meh produce and the rest just is expensive compared to supermarkets  the point is all this pearl clutching over organized retail theft from 20222023 was them lying through their teeth to their investors costco wasnt very subtle back in 2022 in calling them out for that smokescreen this subreddit of course believed it and blamed biden  now everyone who was dumb enough to be greedy when others are fearful and bought shares is looking and feeling stupid but im sure that dividend is providing copium  i was totally saying theft is cool and fine  

reading must be hard for some  i mean duh but i didnt think the price differences were that much of a difference  na when feeding my family i go out of my way to find places that offer vibes and atmosphere fuck my wallet  youd be surprised  sums up why trump won in a landslide lol  yes walmart is the biggest grocer in the country kind of hard to believe as someone who shops mainly at trader joes and whole foods but it makes sense  6 down ytd and flat 5 years

had a big run at some point indeed  it didnt  thats why i bought some just now   youre way off

costco is middle class

if anything target is now working class too their clothing isnt expensive its right there with walmart and what costco offers you dont find 100 shirts or jeans at target

nordstrom rack would be middle class while nordstroms is upper class   walmart is working class

walmart instore is working class w is a free benefit on amex cards and i suspect based on the few people ive talked to who have done it this may create a subset of walmart customers who treat it like amazon  delivery only and never enter the store could be something to watch  yeah the walmarts ive been to lately probably 3 or 4 in the last year when traveling around the us have gone allin on self check which is great  people complain about doing their own checking but before youd be in a tenminute line for the one 95 year old checker lady so its clearly better for me at least  dont know what its like in america but here in ireland it feels like theres 2 class of people now those who own their home and those who dont

those homeowners especially those who bought even just a couple years ago are doing fine theyre seeing wage increases and as their house purchase price is locked in its fine

while renters are seeing house prices soar rents soar and are living month to month  aldi is goated  to quote marge simpson we cant afford to shop at any store with a philosophy  rent and housing costs are just too damn high i work 55  hours a week and can barely afford my tiny studio apartment i only make like 17 an hour but still  i used to talk shit about walmart and now we are walmart subscribers because of the delivery aspect  i feel like it was undervalued to begin with target is literally one of the only stores left that is an activity rather than just a store the teens go there to hang out they are opening two new targets near me right now they have clothing that is affordable and stylish their customer services is amazing they might have to be less lax on their returns though  your broker works for you tell him to take his moral horse until afterwork or you get someone who is working for his clients  lol as much as id like to yolo options i want to have kids one day and cant risk my savings for something like that i try not to buy anything i wouldnt plan to hold for at least a year  fr do you want to shop with hot moms or obese welfare recipients on electric scooters with 96 cans of pepsi in the cart ill pay a few dollars more for the former  this is facts  broits not 2004 anymore no one goes to target  why would you do this  as much as reddit wants to disregard the right as a group of fringe crazies theyre about half the country i definitely think thats part of it i know a lot of people who dont shop there anymore because of that stupid shit  really look at the woke companies starbucks nike disney etc now tell me how theyre doing exactly  its definitely less jobs online is more efficient so way less workers and a lot of stores close down  yeah so instead of working facing the public you can work in a giant windowless maze the size of 5 targets just the further atomification and self isolation of our society pretty soon there will never be a reason to leave your house  i always love this shit in a store it requires a person at least someone to just look to see if someones not stealing at self checkout and for stocking but what happens when this is shifted to warehouse 

well fuck hiring people when i can just have an automation system built now that will pick any part or product for the cost of electricity fuck hiring staff for my small business when i can run the commerce marketing and finances from my  single laptop  gig jobs with no security protections or benefits  depends on where you live how good of health youre in family circumstances etc  at 20hour the cheapest 1 bdrm apartment in my county is going to take up almost 75 of your paycheck before taxes

is sleeping indoors a luxury lifestyle now  target sucks because its hard to rob is quite the take  commercial rents are way overpriced and maybe warehouses are underpriced  savings are even greater if you have staple items on subscription basis  walmart online beats amazon on the regular i definitely do more business with them due to price  they have one for 99yr with 2day shipping or same day delivery  just no streaming perks like amazonwalmart  it seems like they are trying to operate brick  mortar stores as normal stores and warehouses but refuse to allocate the payroll necessary to be successful in doing so i feel terribly for the demoralized employees who are being stretched impossibly thin  oh they absolutely will constantly hire new people they just wont give them many hours some working 4 hours a week even though theyre promised 20 and they cut hours from the employees already on staff  yup heb is so pleasant and the staff bags your groceries correctly love heb good customer service always wins

i go into kroger and its not as pleasant and food quality is not as good i go into target and see one cashier and self check out the light is dim and stores look a bit disoriented i miss target of yesteryearsthe ceo needs to go what has he done to my tarjay  nobody shops at walmart because its jovial  shits cheap  why should minimum wage workers smile at you lol such a weird entitlement to have   in a super center no way what state  i had an exchange on diapers we got from a baby shower i gave up after 20 mins went across the street to target and got store credit in like 5 mins i avoid walmart at all costs at least the couple in my area are horrendous  must be storespecific  i go a couple times of week and never wait for more than one person usually  its corporate policy is to charge 14 on outside items and 15 on kirkland brand items theres a podcast called acquired that does a deep dive into the business and its history they have very few skus so every corporate buyer can gain additional knowledge of the products they purchase and the cost rational from the company 

costco wanted to sell mixed nuts and mixed nuts sell well but their buyers didnt understand the margins based on costs from the established brands so costco only sells their own blend for staples the market analysis is probably even easier with more available data  those with a 150 200 25k income and moderately savvyy investing they value time and  so going to walmart given upwards inflation is a way to protect time and  walmart got this and gets me as a client could i go to a nicer better looking store of course but then i feel self duping as an investor  depends on how fast and aggressive the admin is with the tariffs suppliers and stores arent going to wait to raise prices if they see the cost increases set in stone  good thing a lot of stuff i bought will last years i might honestly never have to buy trash bags again  deleted  its cute you think companies wont raise prices immediately either to gradient into necessarily higher prices later or just cause theyll take any reason to raise prices when they have something external to blame  nope i didnt forecast that supply chain issues and super low interest rates would cause inflation but in insight i should have live and learn  who knows all we have is their word to go on right now but indications are that theyre going to approach this time differently also very funny that the best case scenario is that the administration is either lying or incompetent  lol the downvotes whenever you say anything negative about that goon i guess too many trump supporters in reddit funny how they roam reddit and still think his policies benefits the economy  i mean she probably bought 23andme once and then never again right

seems like you had the right data but the wrong conclusion  i also choose this guys wifes spending habits  target is 12  the main issue is just bad commercial real estate speculation stores expanded based on highly optimistic assumptions and they either bought land or locked themselves into long leases with bad terms

target corporation has a target demographic profile of pricesq ft and priceacre when compared to medianmean income within the area and housing prices within the area if you run the low performing stores through those metrics theyre the ones that wouldnt get approved as a viable real estate play today  theyre not ill pay a few cents more and go to a store thats clean   sums up why trump won in a landslide lol  

i dont think you know what a landslide is  ride it down the rest of the way i like it  whats the difference between nordstrom and nordstrom rack  exactly what were seeing here the emergence of the asset owning class and the working class the asset owning class owns their homes and plenty of stocks the fed printed a ton of money and went all in on qe and this inflated asset prices

if your housing costs are fixed and your net worth doubled in recent years youre sitting pretty if you dont own assets then the last few years have been brutal with inflation figures likely feeling understated additionally food and housing inflation have been particularly bad and those disproportionally take up a larger portion of the budget of a typical working class family  ya i saw this in silicon valley and other hcol places ppl with low interest locked in low home prices are doing amazing with rising incomes ppl with market rate shelter costs are suffering because rising incomes arent matching the obscene housing costs 

  
end up with a k shaped society causing frustration  america is large so cannot talk on all of it but in my area of high housingrent you are definitely doing better if you bough anytime 3 or more years ago before interest rates jumped my mortgage is significantly lower now than local rents like 20 or more less it was pretty even when i bough 45 years ago  lidl too  aldi for the dry goods local mexican joint for meat and produce even accounting for the time suck its still cheaper than jewelmarianossprawlmart  plus is a game changer havent stepped in a walmart even for groceries in last 3 months and the best thing is i get my groceries delivered in an hour or less just for 3 without having to pay for express delivery just because the demand is not there yet   yeah i get w as a bonus on an amex card and its great i will cut my hand off before i have to actually go into a walmart if i need more than a selfcheckable basket of items but with delivery its fine  yeah my guy will tell me im being a dumbass but he would do it anyway  its not his job to prevent me from being a dumbass  i wouldnt care because i would never see either of those people again rather have the money  ah yes thinking with the peepee has never steered anyone wrong  they are 22 of the country according to elections statistics half the country is just what they want everyone else to think lol  theyre all not broke and isnt big tech super woke the largest companies in the market  thats just cherry picking  i have had this dystopian thought that in the future their wont be many retail stores everything will just be warehouses that you order online and pick up or delivered  have you ever worked retail i guarantee you 90 of the people would rather put items in boxes than dealing with the demands of insane customers  as an introvert this sounds good to me  ill take that over having to talk to a bunch of karens all day  so many people eat like our healthcare is free  you can build a warehouse in the middle of fuckin nowhere as long as your trucks and employees can get there target needs to be in a high traffic location with a big parking lot real estate for the latter is significantly more expensive  you guys are in luck because trump is gonna bring manufacturing factories back to the us no more 4 hours everyone can work to their hearts content 12 hours shift 7 days a week  common courtesy if i come up and smile and ask you a question the normal reaction is to have a similar reaction im not asking them to be stepford wives just dont be rude assholes  youre stocking shelves ive been there it is not difficult at all you will be fine   wi may be they just analyze if they have lots of losses from theft at the self check outs and our area is not very affected by it  exactly  and the greedy pricks can double dip  raise prices based on incoming tariffs and then raise prices again when the tariffs are actually implemented  hell they can raise prices again after that too when they start seeing prices on imports going up

its gonna be a shit show  most of it is journalism trying to get views over inflation fears but the fed will keep cutting rates campaign promises are just promises very very few administrations actually deliver

forgiveness and clearly visible inflation drivers from both administrations 

but a campaign promise suddenly is a game changer  they do offer more than just the blood test now but yea not the same   correct lower is better  leases are a huge problem commercial real estate is an enormous bubble and the few leasees they have are losing their shirts trying to pay rent  thats what i think too but i guess the earnings say otherwise  hell yeah buy high sell low  only if you assume all non voters disagree with them id guess theyre about equally ideologically split especially on social issues which people tend to be more in tuned to  kinda of already half way there but i think there will always be a need for retail space maybe just a bit less its definitely nice to see stuff in person and try things on sometimes  having worked both retail jobs and jobs in mail order warehouses i would choose the latter every time fuck dealing with karens every day  after working retail ill never work another customer facing job i doubt im alone in that sentiment  im an introvert and i still think this attitude is extremely unhealthy  cant argue with that  i imagine you get very pissy in europe eh  astronomical qe

student debt moratorium rentmortage moratorium

student debt moratoria and forgiveness have always been controversial ideas and the idea that the media didnt criticize them is absurd i have no clue what mortgage moratorium youre talking about or rent moratorium for that matter  seems like a really good buy considering q4 is usually a whopper  i mean yeah its an assumption that is safer to make than half of nonvoters are so political they will boycott stores but wont go vote  but the remaining 28 to get to that 50 number are already too apathetic even to vote do you truly think they are motivated enough to follow some flimsy boycott 

my parents are unfortunately deep in the maga cult and still shop at target their attention spans are fickle theyve already forgotten about that culture war fox news has manufactured like 20 pointless culture wars since then 

also the original poster who made this claim has apparently never heard the common phrase correlation does not imply causation they are just making an assumption based on no data and claiming it as fact  exactly even introverts need human contact and to not have an inherent distrust of others  eh most people i met were courteous one purposefully rude person in paris but otherwise it was fine cant find a single walmart worker that doesnt seem like they wanna off themselves unfortunately   i guess google is down

coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act created a foreclosure moratorium for federally backed mortgages on march 18 2020 the moratorium ended on july 31 2021

yes the fed is independent of any party doesnt mean they get a pass for inflationary pressures 

media outlets and even the fed were all saying inflation is transitory and just due to supply chain issues 

and student loans were paused for 4 years

theres more hysteria over a campaign promise than any of the actual factors that lead to inflation  i disagree but also dont care enough about the topic to keep arguing lol would rather discuss if this is a buying opportunity or not  people think introvert means no human contact when the reality is its more quality over quantity i dont have a ton of friends but the ones i do have are my brothers and sisters for life

the problem is now theres so much you can do without human contact at all that people have replaced it in their lives and then we wonder why our society is falling apart  an eviction moratorium is not a rent moratorium if you didnt pay your rent in that time the landlord could evict you once the moratorium ended 

states with cold weather prohibit utilities from disconnecting people during the winter so they dont freeze to death that doesnt mean that people arent obligated to pay their electric bill 

media outlets and even the fed were all saying inflation is transitory and just due to supply chain issues 

and they were correct inflation is now below 3 it was caused by supply chain disruptions and it was killed without raising unemployment to 10 which people like larry summers thought was necessary or do you think the eviction moratorium caused inflation to spike all across the world  fair enough",0.7964,0.9997,1
Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"firstly apologies for my english its not my first language

my stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against asml after the last earnings report the following are the ones i am aware of

1120  bronstein gewirtz  grossman llc  
the complaint alleges asml misrepresentet or failed to disclose that 1 the issues being faced by suppliers like asml in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than asml had indicated to investors 2 the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than defendants had publicy acknowledged 3 asml had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology

1120  glancy prongay  murray llp

the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false andor misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the companys business operation and prospects

have also done the same with similar allegations raised against asml now it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one ive never really assumed there was any misleading being done sometimes you raise guidance sometimes you lower guidance 

  
i assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits but ive not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites i follow which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal i am however not very knowledgeable on american law regarding these kinds of lawsuits

that one you posted  irrelevant 

gamers suing msft for buying activision  irrelevant

epic suing aapl  googl for appstore  relevant

doj suing googl for illegal monopoly  relevant  little nothing lawsuit hope it brings fear so i can buy cheaper asml isnt going anywhere  materially false and misleading statements is the only serious allegation the bronstein lawsuit is just a harassment with a purpose to extract some money in a settlement

however there is a high threshold to prove that the statements were false and misleading the statements are usually prepared by external accounting  business analysis companies and approved by a corporate counsel it is exceedingly rare that the ceo would overwrite those with own materially false claims in particular in a netherlands company of such high visibility

so i think those are very likely all harassment lawsuits aimed at extracting some money from the company as some of its large shareholders lost some money

without knowing the details it makes sense to ignore them  these lawsuits have zero chance of succeeding but im happy for the buying opportunity they help to create  the lawyers that file these kinds of claims are called ambulance chasers opportunistic

just ignore them theyll be thrown out  no one and i mean no one can do what they do they build the most complicated tools ever designed by man short term idk massive china issue but long term they will be fine without them no semiconductor company can make anything youd want to buy   that is absolutely frivolous  theyre probably next to nothing in the grand scheme of things for such a huge company and its sent by your stock broker who have their own biasnessintentions to want you to short the shares  thanks thats what i thought i just never got these notifications before so i wasnt sure what to think  if you google these law fimrs you can see how they lawsuits different firms during the years nothing new",-0.882,-0.5472,-1
"Trading algorithms, how do they operate?","at 930 basically everything starts moving the same directions including crypto im just wondering how this happens is it that all the major players use the same basic algorithm or that there are many different algorithms that see what the others are doing and react to each other in a chain reaction

whats the general logic they use to make decisions are there people directing them at all or is it just totally automated

now almost all major firms use custommade tools often developed inhouse however most of them are built on the same basic principles and trained on the same datasets smaller firms usually outsource the software from someone else  read the book flash boys for a look into some of the high frequency tasting world  buy high sell low  and retail trading is pretty much guessing what the algos will do and try to do it before them

the nvda wild swings yesterday after hours got me thinking about it like is that just algorithms sensing bad guidance in a millisecond then selling  buying massive amounts amongst themselveseach other so fast that they make billions in a couple minutes  youre not going to be able to react in real time on the retail side your best bet is anticipation of whats to come so if youre watching the markets daily and you see how things are trading especially if youre sitting there watching the 15minute chart while youre doing something else hours and hours and hours of this you start to get a feel for whos trading what this is of course if youre only trading a few specific assets and you stick to those eventually you should be able to correctly anticipate what the market will do in the future with a reasonable degree of accuracy thats more or less the short version of what ive been doing for years 

a good example would be during the ftx crash all the crypto markets sell off heavily bitcoin is down under 20000 at that point if youre a forward thinker you realize that the greed of humanity will drive this up again the narrative is still there hands will pick it up so you position yourself in anticipation of whats to come and now you look at your positions and most of them are up anywhere between 3 and 10x you can do this with virtually any asset small caps would be another one neglected for years you start running your historical statistics trump wins narrative is there small caps likely to do well they have been doing well  something like that could you recognize it before them probably not you may ride the wave for you cant initiate it  so buy the dip",0.0,0.8173,0

top line been growing at 4030 range for the past 9 qs

the issue you are glancing over is management that is why the stock been hammered could the company deliver gaap profitability previous and current management that is the key metric 

why are they even spending a billion to buyback stock inherently its a fine growing business no shocker the issue is was and will be capital allocation and management  this reads so much like a chatgpt generated comment  i bought at 125 2 years ago  im in it for the long haul the consumption from its customers will only increase  it is gonna get bigger because they use other infrastructures to do their queries they dont have their own infrastructure to for storage and compute  if ppl have issues with snow sbc would love to see their reaction when they find out dbrx is substantially higher with lower revenues and worse margins  why what does apache spark have to do with storage solutions like amazon s3 isnt spark competitors with googles hadoop  both will exist   my cost basis is even higher via skilled investing  i understand you want a pat on the back but the market returned 30 since then holding securities blindly isnt really a skill to be proud of good luck though  theyre spending a billion to buyback stock because they pay way too much in rsu packages that has always been their problem  oh how can they make money then wont they bankcrupt at the end  thats not why and thats not how selling servers on public cloud infrastructure works  the cost of renting storage and servers from cloud providers is much lower than the revenue generated by the product built on that infrastructure

saas companies use public cloud infrastructure so that they only pay for what they use only use what they need and can scale up instantly with customer growth

snowflake isnt profitable yet because of other costs like employees and rd  not sure how true this is we use snowflake and have storage in aws we pay snowflake for the compute and aws for storage  lets see in 5 years not everyone is a trader some invest for the long term  they use other cloud services but build products on top so they can charge customers more than they snowflake pay for compute themselves  its not always cheaper you could have shitty revenues or really inefficient systems that kill all margins but in this case yes the money is significant on r and d  i wonder who the downvote could possibly be from  lol no one here is long term investor and being long term doesnt mean hold at any value there is something called opportunity cost and the kicker

i would bet you and op got zero knowledge of the business and fundamentals you are a trader like everyone in the online platform monkey see monkey do everyone buying and selling without reason so spare me the long term bullshit",0.9908,0.9946,1
I Still Can’t Understand WHY? And Why Keep Going? I just Don’t Get It!!,"ugmoney1965httpswwwredditcomusergmoney1965 on rwolfspeed_stonk

how would you explain it to a judge

when this first started and the stock price was at 142 i sort of understood it the institutional buyers came in and bought 984 of every single share that the company had issued by dec 2021 between the institutions and the management team they already owned 110549191 shares of the 112346000 shares issued and outstanding by the company at that time

i have never shorted a stock and the bullshit excuse that they always give regarding the need for shorting shares to add liquidity into the market is complete and total bullshit but at least i understood why wolfspeed stock was being shorted back in 2021  2022

in 2020  2021 the institutions were wetting themselves to own the single largest sic manufacturer in the world that was just getting ready to undertake an expansion to blow the sic market wide open and further expand their lead in the sic market and to even take a bite out of the silicon market but the stock did get out in front of itself

and all of that did make sense up until 31 december 2023

but on 31 december 2023 something changed dramatically shorting wolfspeed went from being an investment into something sinister nefarious and illegal

on 31 december 2023 short interest was only 15651500 shares look at the short interest during the second half of 2023 it dropped from 20 million shares down to 156 million shares up to this point everything looked normal investors shorted the stock and when they figured they made all their money they covered their positions and moved on pretty normal stuff that is how the market works

but something changed on 1 jan 2024 starting on 1 jan the people who started shorting wolfspeed were no longer investors during q1 2024 someone decided to short 46 million shares the stock price fell from 45 down to 25 but these people are no longer investors if you are an investor when you make your money you leave your position and by 31 march short interest had gone from 15 million shares back up to 20 million shares  

and less than three weeks later 19 april is when i caught shaolin capital management getting into the action from 1 jan  31 mar short interest went up by 46 million shares and on 19 april is when shaolin made the single dumbest trade that i have ever seen in the stock market in 35 years someone shorted 46 million shares in q1 and the stock price dropped from 45 down to about 25 so shaolin figured if they shorted their 375 million shares the stock price would probably drop down to 10 or so but they got the rude awakening when the institutional shareholders bought all 375 million shares and the stock price went up by 6share

and this is where i start to get really confused

if you are a normal investor you take your losses and move on shaolin tried to cover their 375 million shares between 5 may  12 june and i have already hashed this timeline until im blue in the face but it would appear that whoever is shorting wolfspeed is no longer just acting as a normal investors since the first of the year short interest has gone up by 20 million shares i understand that they know that they cannot ever cover their positions but since 14 june they have made their illegal activities blatantly obvious i dont know if this is sheer desperation or what but they just keep making their situation worse and my estimates today are that they will lose at least 10  15 billion in a short squeeze at least 2  3 times what the gamestop hedge funds lost in 2021

and the single biggest question for me is that if these guys end up in court what will they use as their defense as to why they are trying to short wolfspeed stock down to 000

trying to explain to a judge why you think the single largest producer of silicon carbide in the world who just went through a 7 billion expansion to increase their production by 30fold and you have to convince a judge that you believe that wolfspeed is going out of business because there is no other explanation other than the fact that you might be colluding with someone else to try to steal the company in some form of a takeover after you have driven the stock price down to 8share

it is just incredibly difficult for me to get my head around this and im trying to imagine how you explain your logic to a judge

if anyone here has some logic feel free to share it how would you try to explain to a judge your logic for making the stock of a company like wolfspeed go to zero or do you just try the old gee we made a mistake and got scared so we just kept shorting the stock defense i just dont get it

its just pure madness",Intelligent-Snow-930,2024-11-22 10:32:30,0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx06vj/i_still_cant_understand_why_and_why_keep_going_i/,,"you just dove right in lol posts usually start with context  like walking into a movie halfway through  we doing schizoposting in this sub now  you ever think that maybe because the business is not that good is losing tons of money each quarter and is leveraged to the tits and in crazy amounts of debt the stock decline makes complete sense

the companys financials look awful q3 rev was 195mil but the cogs was 231 mil not even including opex how is that investable  tldr  fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals wolfspeed held a dominant position in sic substrates and epi until chinese companies started to sell material of comparable quality at half the price their margins went to toilet that coincides with wolfspeeds multibillion dollar investment in capacity expansion and transition from 150 to 200mm wafer size their timing couldnt have been worse in addition they made another multibillion dollar investment in a brandnew dedicated 200mm chip fab in utica ny the chip production started last year but the fab is still operating well below 50 capacity if that wasnt bad enough 2024 is a year of global pullback in ev demand which has beed the main driver of sic growth that caused an oversupply and resulted in price erosion so every sic device wolfspeed ships is probably wrapped in a 1 bill theyre trying to stop the bleeding by shutting dow their old chip fab in research triangle nc and laying off 20 of workforce the ceo was just fired without naming the successor 
so buckle up its going to be a bumpy ride the good news is that sic value prop is fundamentally sound it enables high efficiency electric power conversion for transportation data center industrial consumer and utility grid eg renewables applications which means wolfspeed may get acquired by a bigger power or analog semiconductor company that buyer will have to be a usbased company because the technology is of strategic importance to dod  dude have you not looked at how shit their balance sheet and income statements are looking

net liabilities growing faster than assets operating expenses growing faster than revenue growth

huge and increasing operating losses the price to book ratio isnt even that heavily discounted 

this company is burning money in a high interest rate environment to manufacture a product that has low barrier to entry and no moat

did you mistake a manufacturing company for a tech stock and then just refuse to do any real research or peer comparison to find out why it wasnt growing or producing value like actual tech companies with high margins and growth with modest operating cost increases  madness thats normal

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"after some research i really beleive this stock is gold

viking therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for vk2735 at obesityweek

subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 82 from baseline and 68 placeboadjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg as far as i am concerned i believe this is more effective than mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4 of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment 

also oral vk2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with 99 of adverse events classified as mild or moderate the oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience 

lets look at subcutaneous vk2735 resultor like doses weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 147 from baseline up to 88 of treated patients achieved 10 weight loss compared to 4 for placebo weight loss was progressive throughout the study with no plateau at 13 weeks

the obesity drug market is projected to grow to 130 billion by 2030 offering significant upside for vk2735 this is also important because at this size of a market it can hold many or multiple big players analysts also predict viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline this would boost the price up to 3 digits

whats more the company also received praise for its liver disease treatment vk2809 which showed positive results in a phase 2b trial for mash metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis a serious liver condition affecting 22 million americans reductions in liver fat ranging from 37 to 55 at 52 weeks with response rates 30 reduction as high as 88 far exceed typical benchmarks 

the clinical data reinforce vk2735s potential as a bestinclass obesity treatment with effective weight loss strong safety and durability of results the only reason why the stock hasnt skyrocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of rfk junior and as far as im concerned diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation ive seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad ",ReindeerApart5536,2024-11-22 06:17:53,0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,,"nothing you mentioned suggests that the company is making any money or will make any money

edit they are in fact losing money

and dont ignore the fact that insurance companies are dropping coverage for weight loss drugs  the time to buy was 2 years ago when it was trading around 1020 

now i think you missed the boat 

and tbh i think it already peaked last year  meh  mounjaro real world results is about 20 wt loss  im loaded to this tits on this stock very very very bullish rumor is that they will be announcing a manufacturing partner sometime in the next month with multiple tons of capacity that should demolish any short thesis left the experts all say the same thing about best in class data only a matter of time until the market catches up  adding more on the next gap fill to 38 and amgen about drop some bombs soon mari tide data  agreed on all fronts   pretty sad that our solution for obesity is drugs jfc  so you an insider or what quit wasting our time and tell us lol  thats what the shills always do throw out a bunch of numbers that have nothing to do with making money and act like it proves theyll make money then 2 other shills jump in to confidently say how sure they are about how money money me money now  insurance companies are dropping coverage for weight loss drugs

any reasons why do they drop coverage any issue or something different

i am looking for lly or nvo opportunities  yes everything i mentioned suggest they will make money due to revolutionary drugs  with regards to insurance companies i believe first with 40 of us adults classified as obese and the massive inconvenience it brings people the drug is still going to be popular despite affordability issues since the drug will be a top spending priority for many people second even if people are not getting these drugs en masse there will still be a huge boost in the stock market due to investor optimism to viking drugs note that actually we have seen lesser ph1 data from competition that resulted in a huge pop in their company valuation but the extremely positive results in vikings from obesity week led to minimal price increase again inferring to market makers manipulation but the market will catch on eventually and even more due to further innovations  this guy is right like most pharma stock few makes any money they do tend to skyrocket and then few month later fall hard so if you manage to see the trends and sell at the right time its a good stock to ride but nowhere near a 100 its a good stock to daily trade  can you justify why you think that way  hi this is true but id like to note that for mounjaro participants achieved an average weight loss of 15225 of body weight over 72 weeks depending on the dose 5 mg 10 mg or 15 mg this means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame compare this to viking which is notably only in its phase 2 midstage trial participants experienced a 15 weight loss over just 13 weeks far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them i would like to add tolerability viking is also far superior for mounjaro common side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues typical of glp1 agonists but with vk2735 participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms  hi can you link to where is the source of the rumor if you can thanks  thats what im saying  i would like to hear some real reasons for against this stock and thats the entire reason for my posting to get real and logical refutations from other people and eventually balance it out to make up my own mind  glp1 drugs can cost over 1000 per month per patient or 12000 annually so for large employers with thousands of employees covering these drugs is not an option but again this just means institutions are not covering up these drugs but the demand for the drug is way too massive to dismiss  every pharmaceutical company has revolutionary drugs dont get caught in the flush these people are making bank to use the right words hes right current financials mean everything but goodluck  lol bro as someone in the pharma industry you just have no idea what youre talking about wrong end of dunning kruger revolutionary drugs whatever that means is bs word salad and has little to do with the stock price  can you be more specific in your critique are you saying the drugs i listed in my analysis will not create a market or are the drugs too ineffective  the critique is not necessarily about the effectiveness of the drugs but rather about the broader market and financial issues 

the company is not yet profitable and clinical success does not guarantee commercial success many promising drugs fail to translate into meaningful revenue due to regulatory delays manufacturing etc gmp and gdp is hard and eu regs especially are rough 

the market for weightloss drugs is becoming crowded with established powerhouses like novo nordisk and eli lilly wegovy is a meme viking will need significant resources to carve out market share

lastly the issue of insurance coverage is critical if insurers are scaling back coverage for weightloss drugs even effective treatments may struggle to gain traction as outofpocket costs might soar major factor limiting the broader adoption of similar therapies
could the stock moon tho of course this shit is all random anyway  hi thanks for the more detailed responses but my position is still largely unchanged and several responses

1 your first concern only manifests if i choose to hold until commercialization but i can name in numerous pharma firms who made very promisable profits before even full on commercialization ie before the full commercialization of its covid19 vaccine modernas market valuation surged due to strong phase 3 trial results government contracts and partnerships also biontech rose to prominence during its covid19 vaccine development with pfizer achieving substantial valuation gains after earlystage clinical success this will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts i provided

2 the market for viking is dominating looking as of now ive responded to someelse to but here let me restate the comparative advantage of viking first is tolerability for mounjaro common side effects include nausea vomiting diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues typical of glp1 agonists but with vk2735 participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms id also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of mounjaro due to side effects now compare the frequency to viking for mounjaro participants achieved an average weight loss of 15225 of body weight over 72 weeks depending on the dose 5 mg 10 mg or 15 mg this means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame compare this to viking which is notably only in its phase 2 midstage trial participants experienced a 15 weight loss over just 13 weeks far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them these all prove that viking has a clear comparative edge as of now unless you can disprove these facts

3 i think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term but in the long run i believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment 

if you still maintain your position i really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day im just an average investor looking for more insights",0.908,0.9973,1
What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"what am i misunderstanding about spyi

it is often recommended that investors just stick to etfs such as spy because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks if i am correct spy has a like a 78 return all time and closer to like 10 or higher in the last couple years 
anyway i see sps high income etf is just under 12 ttm so does that mean if i have 100000 i would get 11950 in dividends a year wouldnt this be higher than the growth and ttm combined spy has if so why wouldnt everyone just invest in this and get 12 dividends a year

so if you invest 100000 in a dividend stock you might get the 7 high yield divi but if you invested the same in a tech stock it might have grown 25 in the same year  so really you lost potential earning

ispy is very different and risky  it gets the very high yield from daily covered calls  so your losses could be much more if the market goes down  they dont have a long track history to see what it would do in a bear market  i would be very careful investing long term in ispy  two things to consider with dividend stocks

1 you pay taxes on those dividends while buy and hold you can defer until later 
2 the dividend usually comes at the expense of the share price so you make get 10k in dividends but your net asset value will decrease to 90k 

its the second one that dividend bros forget  if i am correct spy has a like a 78 return all time

sort of but also not really over the longterm several decades a 78 average after adjusting for inflation is probably reasonable but thats not a guarantee the sp 500 averaged about 55year from 2000 to 2020 and closer to 1year from 20002012 

wouldnt this be higher than the growth and ttm combined spy has if so why wouldnt everyone just invest in this and get 12 dividends a year

heres what youre missing 

 spyis 12 yield is only partly dividends dividends are essentially a form of profit sharing and the sp 500 current dividend yield is about 13 if you bought something like spyd the highestdividend stocks in the sp 500 the yield is about 4

 much of the 12 yield from spyi is due to covered calls which is a complicated form of options where other investors pay you money for the option to buy the stocks you hold now 

 this can generate a lot of income and it works well if stocks are steady or going up but if the stocks go down you can be forced to sell at a loss to the people who hold the option contract look up what happened to qyld a few years ago similar strategy and it hasnt recovered from the covid crash  that makes sense thank you  isnt the dividend also higher during draw downs at least thats what ive noticed for the premium etfs  i watched spyi for about 12 months before jumping in  its true that the growth isnt the same as spy but there hasnt been any net value decrease so far aside from the first few months  i got in at 4960 in may and its at 5219  and while spy has gone from 529 to 590 in the same frame  i didnt have enough capital to make it beneficial

ive seen 3200 in dividends and 2600 in growth on 50k in those 6 months for roughly 5800  in that same amount of time in spy would have yielded 8400

this just happens to be my strategy for my 401k where i balance growth etfs with dividend etfs  thats for the response follow up questions

1 if it is in my roth that wouldnt matter right

2 i dont understand that wouldnt it increase my net assets by 12  100000 original investment  11950 ttm  111950  i appreciate the detailed response   how can a covered call force you to sell of the price goes down thats not how it works   we have spyi qqqiand qyld  we have these in the traditional ira and our hsa we purchased ata good price so all up about 6 or so   this is just one of our plays with owning selective mags stocks and voo  i really like them in our hsa fund   it literally pays for our medical without having to draw down the principal oh our boo is up 40 from last year or so  no the divi does not go up when the price goes down in covered call etfs  you also watched it during a huge spy bull run so all youve seen is the ccs capping gains but no nav loss  as you pointed out it still underperformed buy and hold spy 

on a down year its going to be catastrophic  when a dividend is paid the stock price decreases by the amount paid out the money doesnt just come out of thin air  why is the divi in jepi higher in down months then wouldnt the increased volatility lead to higher premiums on options and thus higher dividend payments  cc funds outperform the underlying in a down year for the underlying  it isnt 11 the asset may just not increase in value  where company z may have x amount of growth or cash on hand and the value of the company goes up the company with a dividend pays it out to shareholders and the price goes sideways  i would say the dip usually comes from people selling after dividend date  im not trying to start an argument but this is a bit of a truism the pricevalue connection is remarkably elastic and a fair amount of the time companies are really good at destroying the value of retained earnings they could have paid out as a dividend  the dividend is up in down months because jepi is doing roc and is essentially charging you a fee to give your money back to you 

these cc income funds look good but they are a huge dividend trap and should be avoided  only if the premium outpaces the nav erosion  from an accounting principles perspective it is 11 market conditions can change the stock price but at a pure principles level the cash paid out comes directly from the companies assets  or large institutions they keep track of shyt like that  there is no nav erosion if the market is declining and your calls never end up being exercised  sure but is every dividend stocks price based exclusively on how much cash on hand it has no  if the premium generated from the calls is less than the yield of the fund then they have to sell the underlying at a loss to make the yield and the nav itself erodes in a down market simply because the underlying asset is down 

you shouldnt talk about things you dont understand  you should consider your own advice cc funds dont have a fixed yield so if premium is light then so is yield they dont eat into assets to pump yield  depends on the fund many attempt to always hit the same yield like qyld and will use roc to achieve this if they have to  you need to read the prospectus

Nvidia Options Action 11/21: Confusion,"so i have 3 nvidia calls 160 1129 150 1129 and 150 11725 pl on the three is about even and got the 160 a few days ago on a dip trying to make a few bucks betting on earnings driving the price up as we all saw they crushed earnings and the stock moved up a few points

what im confused about is the value of my contracts dropped pretty significantly at open although the stock was up ive been trading options here and there for the past couple years and seen some odd action before but nothing like that seems completely opposite what youd expect can some explain why that happened not particularly pressed a little disappointed cuz i wanted to sell the 160 at open but just confused",Independent-Skin-550,2024-11-21 20:15:36,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwhx38/nvidia_options_action_1121_confusion/,,"iv crush  you just learned what iv crush is  httpswwwredditcomroptionscomments1gwhtu4nvidia_calls_went_downly9az3t  1 iv relative to what it was at close yesterday right
2 i assume once the dust settles if and when people stop selling so many contracts the value of my contracts would go up is that a valid assumption  yes for nvidia the rise and fall in implied volatility around earnings is much higher than typical stocks 

no the value of the premiums was increased around earnings based on your post i assume you bought your contracts close to er  ok thanks for the info 

iv was high bc people were waiting on earnings earnings came out and iv dropped causing the value to drop i knew volatility played a part in the value equation didnt realize a swing could negate an upward movement 

ya learn something new everyday lol  you said you traded options for years you didnt know about iv crushing profits  i traded options in sp 500 upro and other etfs rarely individually stocks and i didnt trade that frequently i could be wrong as im just learning about iv crush lol but i would imagine the iv of etfs doesnt fluctuate as much as stocks like nvidia

i mentioned times i found price movement odd and looking back it was probably at least in part due to that 

also this clears up something ive been confused about for a while i understand that some people take profits around earnings but i wondered why stocks that the market seemed to like crushed estimates and provided good guidance dropped after earnings knowing that iv crush is a thing makes it make more sense now although ofc its not the onlymain factor for the drop in price  that is true iv of etfs would still fluctuate around important events for example before and after us election but a lot less than individual stocks that are bound to company schedules  announcements

The Bullish case for OPRA,"with google under pressure from the doj this looks like a huge potential for opera if google was forced to sell chrome this would give smaller browsers like opera a great chance to gain some market share also when you look at browsers excluding edge and firefox opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison they are also one of the only browser stocks that there are at least the only one of any substance 



on the flip side even if google isnt forced to sell chrome then we should see the momentum continue for goog

ive been a long term holder of opra for this very reason they have a steady growing base of 350m users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies ive always looked at opra as a hedge against goog at least as far as their browser is concerned it also pays to hold because they have a great divided

ive been a long term holder of goog too though i think both are great companies but im buying both to more or less hedge my bets

i think opra has a strong chance of seeing some gains if doj does follow through

positions goog 6 shares opra 100 shares

  
tldr opera opra and goog alphabet look like great buys right now",Buy_Ethereum,2024-11-21 23:55:20,0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwmcci/the_bullish_case_for_opra/,,"if google was forced to sell chrome this would give smaller browsers like opera a great chance to gain some market share

how chrome being sold doesnt mean it stops existing why would anyone switch browsers because the company that owns it now has a different name  username checks out  opera has made a perfectly fine browser that many people like for many years even before chrome was the staple browser whether other browsers are owned by google or not isnt going to make opera more popular

now if they reach a bundling deal with dell or something sure this though i dont see it

if somehow opera did manage to increase their userbase substantially and in a relatively sudden way id be all over it the fact that theyre a profitable company is pretty interesting

also you have to keep in mind that close to half of operas revenue is adsearch payments from google for driving traffic to their search whats bad for google isnt necessarily bad for opera but if google cuts their payments for advertising or search referrals that would be really bad and i wouldnt put it above google to try to run a browser competitor out of business if they win this doj case

ittech expert who has used opera on and off for almost 20 years  the mega comeback of mozilla firefox lol  the doj is about to get gutted only way its a good idea for google to comply and not fight this until the incoming administration is if taking this action nullifies  eu antitrust proceedings someone else jump in with this info  anyone else read it as oprah  i took a small opra position recently because of this   opera gx is a gaming browser that doesnt directly support gambling but it does offer a catalog of offshore bookmakers with working links

ok i understand that opera doesnt advertise gambling  still i say gaming  gambling  profit

ill see how it plays out over the next 6 to 12 months  this entirely depends on how the doj goes about breaking them up if they force chrome to sell i dont think theres a company in the market who would be allowed to buy them andor have the funds to acquire it

if thats the case other browsers would be given an opportunity to gain the market share that chrome would be losing

  
edit im imagining this the same way telecom was broken up back in the early 2000s the companys split into smaller companies that were eventually gobbled back up over time  the alternative to no buyer exists isnt to destroy the product its to spin it off as its own company no

that sounds like the reasonable thing to do at least

edit due to your edit in the case of a spinoff the core question remains why would anyone switch to opera just because the owning company of chrome now has a different name  no  in theory yes that would be the right choice like i said though it entirely depends on how the doj goes about breaking them up  it doesnt though does it youre basically saying there is a realistic chance for the doj to force google to basically delete chrome off the face of the earth as thats the only way consumers would move to other browsers unless another browser company buys chrome but if that company isnt opera it still doesnt matter and if it is opera it will have cost them money to buy chrome but that aside you even said this isnt an outcome you expect so back to square one

i just cant see a universe where that would be the outcome  this assumes that google even gets broken up trump will be president soon doj will likely get shaken up any decision wont be made until summer of 2025 and will probably be appealed  you still didnt answer the question",0.9894,0.9851,1

like legit insider info theyd tell me about a stock etc and wed track it and info was realcrazy not sure if its still the same  insider trading cases do seem to hit the news its a serious criminal offense and the sec does regulate it probably the most effective regulation andor deterrent is the companies themselves they have a lot to lose if the sec determines that they didnt have proper controls and it really looks bad to explain to management directors and shareholders that the company has lax internal policies potentially opening them up to a lawsuit

it happens but considering how much information can cause a stock to make major moves it really seems to be a low incident rate  only a fraction of the congress actually outperforms the market there was a post showing the best investors in congress and one of them was just based on owning nvidia long enough im sure there is actually insider trading happening but people are too quick to call good investment decisions insider trading

httpswwwredditcomrstockmarkets1zhr7ek9kp  anyone mentioning pelosi and cant mention a single person in the top 5 of the 2023 returns needs to understand they have been successfully programmed

2	mark green rtn 1222
3	garret graves rla 1076
4	david rouzer rnc 1056
5	seth moulton dma 800  these people are literally sitting on bills that might become laws that affect industry for months

they even know the probability of a bill passing before anyone else

not to mention congress polices themselves about insider trading

theres even etf that track their trades since they have to file their trades  since reddit usually has no general idea what the legal hurdles actually are to be convicted for a 10b5 violation insider trading posting this older comment  write up i had saved down from some long deleted account

there is a serious legal bar between difficult to find and nonpublic nonpublic implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private such as what officers of a corporation might have they are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic lets illustrate this with a few examples

if an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the companys upcoming earnings and the executive answers 1 honestly 2 without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3 without requiring a promise of confidentiality and nonuse from the analyst then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain because legally the executive has effectively made this information public there is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact but thats really an edge case and isnt relevant here

if i am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work i discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract and i lead the way to securing that contract for my company then 1 it is illegal for me to trade my own companys stock in response i am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship but 2 it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company because i have no confidentiality relationship with them assuming my employer doesnt restrict this which they might  read your ndas carefully

if your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them and youve been all over the country and draw certain wellfounded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things yes you are allowed to trade on that data legally again in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not which establishes confidentiality if your company is set to profit from this no you cant trade your own companys stock  that generally constitutes illegal inside trading

if i am sitting in a starbucks and i overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging and this information has not yet been released to the public i am allowed to trade on this information the information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery conversely if i see them in the starbucks and bribe them for information i am not allowed to trade on the information because i established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship

insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood it is so misunderstood and so nuanced that matt levine a columnist at bloomberg who writes money stuff has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up because theyre complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column the media as an aggregate group reporting on this subject has fixated on the idea that congress is exempt from insider trading but that is not factual it doesnt help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which regardless of whether or not its wellfounded im not going to comment on that somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply dont understand what wall street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there it does quite a lot as an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a venn diagram with some but not total nor even majority overlap the public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that say your friends and family dont know is illegal to use this is made worse by the portrayal of insider trading in movies and television  thats absolutely not the case  when you have congress sitting on committees that directly relate to stocks they can own yah im sure their decisions are not bias  they all do it and we would be arrested for it but they get richer while doubly fucking us more and more  the biggest ponzuscheme  in history we elected these people to rob the shit out of us  pelosi makes 200k but is worth something like 200m think for a minute  if youre not inside youre outside
gordon gekko  nothing is stopping anyone from doing anything well other than risk of being caught and doing jail time that is  but how often does it actually happen

more often than you think  officials arent making all that money from day to day work lmfao  ridiculous member and their family should be forced to owning only etfs or having a blind trust managed by a professional  its the patients running the asylum in congress  nice try fed lol  does it happen all the frickin time not a big fan of the guy but elon musk is right about one thing the sec is a joke and not to be taken seriously  isnt there a website to see what their doing concerning buying and selling  speaking from what ive seen from friends the platform that awards stocks to management my friend has a lot of restrictions my friends account is classified as work account and he cant trade options there for example there is a lot of things he cant do and i presume thats how platforms try to combat insider trading but the main issue with that is that my friend can easily open an account in another brokerageplatform and do whatever he wants even if we assume that platforms will evolve in a way that they will prevent this too there is no way to stop human interaction my friend can just share the insider information with me and i would do the trades so imo its impossible and pointless to battle against insider trading  rules get broken all the time but the offender does not get caught  how many people excessively speed while driving or run a red light or steal  and what percentage of these people are caught and punished  

i suspect insider trading happens quite often but people are smart about it  smart meaning they dont make an obvious and very large trade that would stick out like a sore thumb  

  
there are many cases of a stock x running up on unusually high volume and then after 2 or 3 days its makes public news that company y is rumored to be in talks to acquire x  the closer an aquistion agreement gets the more people know  

  
tldr  like every other rulelaw some get caught and some dont  its very difficult to prove insider trading unless you have full surveillance of every aspect of two peoples lives  they can chat on the phone in person via email via snail mail using cryptic communications etc  marjorie taylor greene bought a shit load of crowdstrike right before their outage and lost a ton of money on them lol  insider trading is a major fact of life like speeding its only caught sometimes  nanc  so basically a wallet degen has to run for congress and let the rest of us know what hes doing  it actually happens  you can monitor it here  httpswwwquiverquantcom  are there laws in the us against insider trading  check out the folks that bought puts on airline stocks for 911  i got caught for insider trading and fined friend of a friend of a friend said to buy some putscalls i bought like 100 of them made 100k over 3 earnings periods  fine was 2x win plus the 100k in attorney fees i didnt know it was someone inside company until last trades i made sec dont care

the people above me made millions they got fines plus probation and one got jail time

my attorney said they never go after my level but it probably had to prosecute the others with more charges  technically not insider trading

its an upgrade version when they signed something into law and make a trade of affected stock of affected industry prior to said law coming into effect

this is why pelosi tracker has the highest return so far  deleted   there isnt really a way to police it id wager that it goes on a lot more than we know and very few will ever get caughtprosecuted

part of what i do revolves around policing this stuff  its not easy but trade and comms surveillance is one place where ai is making huge strides in finding uncommon patterns both in trade activity and in the language used in communication channels email whatsapp sms etc

its not a huge step from clearly suspicious activity across a few mediums to a personal phone records subpoena and bam  busted

theres no way to truly know how much insider info is being exchanged and acted upon illegally but certainly the new tools are finding maybe 3x more than we were just a few years ago  id say were now catching maybe 1520 of this kind of noncompliant activity

edit  if you work for a brokerdealer i will tell you everything you do any any corporate issued device is captured and analysed  all your email bloomberg messages symphony chats teams sms mms desk phone turret etc etc its all captured stamped with you as the custodian of that info and run through sophisticated monitoring tools  if you wouldnt be comfortable with it appearing on the front page of nyt dont writesay it on a corporate device  theres a way to punish after the fact need someone who has the balls to do so get caught you are now fined the initial investment plus your profit plus 3x the aggregate amount you will also be sent to federal prison without parole id say about 30 years should put enough fear in those that  might want to insider trade 

have an extra stipulation for government employees  the sec definitely catches more people than you realize  it goes on very openly if you watch options flow  well i guess you cheated bc insider trading is taken very seriously and monitored by both the sec and the various financial investment platforms  yep  only small time retail luck gets the flak if youre particularly lucky with a few trades rest assured bigguvs analytical team they use plantir too  will find the correlation of funds transfers the timings and then a probable cause followed by detention warrant to scan your personal email or messaging apps etc etc 


biggest irony is the stock that made you millions pltr will be the same company that taketh all away  if memory serves i think the wife reported the incident when the husband told her what he had done  what if i only made 100  i feel like pelosi isnt a good example honestly tuberville was buying obscure oil exploration companies right before they got their drill permits approved by the government long calls on nvidia panw and qqq doesnt strike me as particularly difficult to figure out or exclusive to those in the know especially given she represents san francisco menendez the guy who got arrested for taking bribes was also insider trading pretty blatantly  biden ran on the chips act  it wasnt some big secret  and selling it was a terrible move  then greene bought a ton of crowdstrike they had their outage and she lost a lot when it plummeted  isnt the penalty like a few hundred bucks or something not much when you make a mil gains per trade  i have yet to see a pelosi trade be a real head scratcher this seems super obvious choice  congress should be banned from trading at all and until they are any and all gains should be assumed to be suspicious  30 days later  paul pelosi has been a vc in silicon valley for decades and came from a very wealthy family im not a big pelosi fan and im not saying everything is above board but there this logic is flawed  surely just a coincidences

fuck the pelosis that shit is painfully blatant  yes  soo where would i need to look  i have a family member who is a partner in a big three accounting firm they have been catching people for decades by looking for unusually successful trading activity and looking for links 

the feds see some housewife sell her entire retirement portfolio one day and start trading options really well and they start seeing who she knows ai will likely make seeing the signals way more effeicnt  if the insider trader is also an ai what then what about market makers simply setting a price is there any defense against that   according to wikipedia the sec investigates over 50 insider trading claims a year im not sure that qualifies as very seriously for a country with an economy the size of the us  bwaaa haaa haaaa  the sec is the biggest joke of an enforcement agency their bosses are the ones that practice insider training they are just a smoke show to tell the poor masses that they are monitoring and regulating these companies and executives  and divorced him  probably  life without parole 

oh youre a senators cousin nvm youre good  paul pelosi seems like he could just be a decent tech investor in an incredible tech bull run  ok but did you know what was going to be in the chips act   i bet pelosi did  think the fine youre talking about is the public filing they have like 30 days or whatever and yet all of them are late  especially when you have insider information  again most of them arent even good at trading there is no major outperformance that would suggest that even with the information they have they can use it to their benefit  i want them to have skin in the game  true but if the timeframe is years  still enough time to catch a bull run

automated trades are the vast majority of trades on any stock market  if someone feeds an automated system insider info  whether its ai or not  thats insider dealing and the person responsible is liable for the consequences  most instances of insider dealing are identified and handled at the institution level using any of a number of mandatory inhouse surveillance tools  only the really serious ones float up to sec level  wait i think the poor guy is actually serious lol  these bills are publicly released before congress votes on them

do you think all laws are secret before they get signed into law  lmfao  i mean i have looked at my own and compared nothing inside about the basics like nvidia meta netflix apple google   i mean i have looked at my own and compared nothing inside about the basics like nvidia meta netflix apple google   a good case of both can be true  my point is that its unethical regardless of how much they supposedly benefit or not from it  the smart ones are not trading in accounts with their own names they probably avoid stocks entirely and focus on something less regulated like land and contracting  bless his heart  your claiming it doesnt happen because congress doesnt have insider info

even something as small as knowing the contents of single months  jobs report would be extremely valuable information 

there is no lack of things to tempt someone into getting rich  definitely thats why generalizations dont really help  your claiming it doesnt happen because congress doesnt have insider info

selfishly  id like syfy to go back to being scifi with actual scifi content maybe bring back reruns of the invisible man knight rider smallville roswell etc and have original movies made like the dune series back in the day 

with nbcsn long gone and usa going itll only leave peacock and nbc to show the premier league theyll probably lean more heavily on peacock 

as it is usa seems to be the least valuable station as it really offers nothing it was just a catch all station that aired nbc reruns and soccer  netflix wrecked em  i cant believe any of the networks listed are of much value the networks that are part of the spinoff also include e syfy golf channel usa and oxygen  i was hoping comcast would keep cnbc oh well  isnt that how it was earlier 

nbc  comcast 

so they are going back within 10 years   msnbc that bad huh  can i short a spinoff 400 days before it happens  is this good for comcast stock  may be comcast will put the knicksrangers game back on

funny outside of cnbc i rarely watch any of the other channels   i still laugh  i got over 500 channels and only watch about 510  they didnt go far enough  the internet provider side of the business should be split off entirely from content  when comcast acquired xumo i knew it was all downhill  separating nbc from msnbc and cnbc hows that gonna work though i understand what theyre thinking in terms of getting rid of something in steep decline but working out who owns what content and contracting to pay for it across two different companies just seems like a giant hassle comes across as a bit of a desperate move to be honest  should be interesting to see how cnbc reports on itself like a son having to report on his pending abandonment by his parents  does that mean cnbc will no longer be called cnbc feels odd this is happening  who will pickup their slack  does wbd make sense here i know they are trying to pay off their debt and buying more cable networks seems backwards but im thinking of the symmetry between them 

csnbcs staff and programming align with cnn top chef is the best food show and one of the few not on food network and then i wonder about sports with wbdtnt losing out on the nba does nbc giving up their cable mean they are giving up nbc sports which just successfully bid on nba coverage

maybe im misunderstanding but it seems like this is wbds path back into sports which could be huge  had heard ratings so bad at msnbc that its not saleable this might be a good time to jettison  so they will become a parks driven business  they think someone will buy msnbc  lol  wbd style  att dumped so much debt on to that spinoff im shocked wbd didnt file for bankruptcy it was an insane number  yep classic corporate move  dump the struggling division before the numbers get any worse wall street 101   as it is usa seems to be the least valuable station as it really offers nothing

i honestly think usa was too far ahead of its time in the 00s they had that exact low effort comfort binge show down to a science by time streaming came out it became popular and consumer preferences shifted in favor of their content the only real benefactor was suits  i remember maybe 1015 years ago when syfy was pumping out tons of lowbudget scifi movies like ice spiders and sharknado these werent objectively good movies but i loved them 

but i havent actually watched any network or cable tv in a long time every channel i used to love turned into almost all reality shows which i cant stand  thats why they canceled good popular shows like chucky  i dont know about most of those but syfy has fallen apart so much over the last 2 decades that at this point its like why didnt you just sell it a long time ago if you were going to mismanage it that badly  usa is the only one with value the rest is worth less than my house  cnbc is my goto money website for looking up stocks on my portfolio 

wonder if it will still keep the name this is pretty huge as far as media conglomerates go really shows the downward trend they are currently facing in the tiktok era  could explain their rightward move need to cozy up to the money  nbc is not cable its broadcast cnbc msnbc etc are cable  nbc staying with comcast  the tv business is dying and no one want depreciating assets and negative cash flow yr after yr  imagine if musk buys msnbc  wbd settled with nba in a three team trade disney gets inside the nbawbd got some international nba rights and big 12 basketball and football nba gets lawsuit ended

it was major news a couple days ago surprised this sub didnt make a thread on it  i dont see how wbd could possibly afford this they already have like 14 billion dollars more in debt than their entire market cap which is typically considered a red flag that a company is in serious danger of going bankrupt

and besides that becoming bigger when youre in a dying industry by acquiring the competition has basically never worked at turning a company around  top chef which is on bravo nbc and peacock are not part of the spinoff  no  the blue sky era was peak  does usa own all the rights to their original shows  i doubt it the peacock logo will be gone and possibly the name with it its going to be hard to compete with bloomberg let alone social media without comcast backing them a shame really  rightward except for a few anchors everybody there is a left wing liberal  i thought nbc cnbc msnbc where all part of nbc universal   fox news is doing well  its just a trend 

httpswwwlightreadingcomnetworktechnologycomcastceodismissescordcuttingtrend  maddow would be railing against the woke left  tucker carlson has a new tv gig within a day  would be hilarious  not sure either way it at least has smackdown for a few years  theyre still cable meaning you cant get them over the air with antenna like you can nbc  wwe puts up better numbers than the history channelthats what youre comparing entertainment to something a bit more substantive

i hate that you got me defending msnbc but 911 neverforget

httpswwwpbsorgnewshourshowfoxnewstopay787msettlementtodominionvotingsystemsoverstolenelectionlies  he already worked there for years   were not having an argument over the substance of the network but the monetary value  but did he work there under musk  wwe is far more valuable than the history channelits legit the same thing fox does well because they sell a lie or a way of viewing the world in a way that draws the attention of more peopleyour life sucks because of or you should be afraid because of xyzthere isnt really an equivalent for liberal mediaand thats what msnbc tries to fill albeit very poorly and more moderately than actual liberal  wasnt really looking for a political debate but to think that msnbc hadnt been selling non stop fear mongering over trump for years is delusional  its not a political debate",0.0258,0.8626,0
"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","qualcomm said on tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional 22 billion per year by 2029

of that amount roughly 4 billion will come from pc chips qualcomm said at its investor day on tuesday the chipmaker just introduced pc processors earlier this year when it released snapdragon x for windows devices

the latest forecast marks an important milestone for qualcomm ceo cristiano amon who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones in fiscal 2024 qualcomms handset business reported 2486 billion in sales about 75 of its entire chip business

qualcomm also said on tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175 by 2029 to 8 billion of which 80 is tied to contracts that have already been secured

we have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile amon said at the investor event

another 4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and 2 billion will come from chips for headsets a category qualcomm calls xr about 4 billion of the forecast is a catchall for other chip sales like those for wireless headphones and tablets

qualcomm shares are up 16 this year trailing the nasdaq which has gained 26

qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for highend smartphones especially those running google android qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to apple for its iphones

but the company has warned investors that apple could choose to stop buying qualcomm parts as soon as 2027 qualcomm said on tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from apple

qualcomms strategy under amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips like modems processors and ai accelerators in new markets including cars pcs and virtual reality the investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as 900 billion

we put a strategy in 21 and were not changing our strategy amon said

laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by intel which has over 70 percent of the market according to mercury research intel reported 29 billion in pc chip sales in its 2023

the competitive landscape changed between the windows and macs amon said referring to apples move in 2020 to switch from intel to its own processors we saw that as an opportunity especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution

the forecast for xr headsets also hints at the growth potential of the vr market over the next five years qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers including meta for its quest and raybans products

when it comes to artificial intelligence qualcomm calls itself an edge ai company in contrast to cloudbased ai thats typically powered by nvidia processors company officials didnt rule out introducing data center products in an interview with cnbc

qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced ai thats restricted to large server farms today an indication that that company may benefit from the ai boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient

what you can run on the cloud last year you can run on the device this year durga malladi qualcomms senior vice president in charge of planning said at the event

intel recently released arrow lake made qualcomm computers irrelevant  just driving a car also uses a lot of chips  working in a big project with partners that develop commercial engineering software and know their clients

x86 is just a massive advantage just because of legacy there are tons of code and binaries in use that are just critical and hard to port to another architecture and translation layers are problematic

so on the pro side specially amd and intel are on the winning team and on the gaming side it seems similar

only the basic web centric use case is where arm can compete something more akin to chromebooks and macbooks but there as architectures are easier to replace riscv could boom too

as i see it arm is under a bigger threat from riscv than x86 under arm  i dont think amd has that level of market power to stop qualcomm they will definitely hit 4b in chip sales by then x elite is already solid and next gen will have big improvements as they move from n4 to n3p we already see 8 elite showing big improvement from x elite 

i expect app compatibility to improve big time as well as adoption increases  amd has arm chips  in what magical manner is this bullsih for intel you think that rev will come from new markets not likely trying to eat at the intelamd duopoly  great insight professor  their smartphone processors had no reason to be   competitive because buyers werent choosing them based on performance they needed a cellular capable soc and qualcomms patents make it the only practical choice on the cellular side so customers had to buy whatever cpu qualcomm wanted to bundle with it  

the only company with the unit volume and pricing power to pay qualcomm separately for the cellular capability and a different cpugpu is apple  doubt    intel recently released arrow lake

i think you mean lunar lake  neither lunar lake nor arrow lake is selling all that well intel even admitted that lunar lake is more of a niche product with terrible margins compared to snapdragon x elite that has been a broadly launched product in the market


snapdragon x elite is fine and developers can use it to further optimise their code for successors that will be released on a regular basis  yea well both new processors by intel and amd perform better across the board while consuming less power and having no restrictions on what apps you can or cant use so theres arm for ya  hes probably talking about the rumor that qcom may buy intc  no insight needed their genuinely shit  legacy compatibility of code is just a massive factor

arm is under a bigger threat by riscv where code compatibility is not an issue if were talking about architecture comparisons

x86 is more than safe and a winning bet especially in professional workloads and gaming  wheres the link chief  intel has fallen behind and they will soon be eliminated  writing off qualcomm after their first gen implementation seems foolish i wouldnt bet against them catching up within 5 years how many engineers have intel lost this year  why  theyre

seriously though why do you say that",0.9698,0.9514,1
Understanding tax implications for international stocks,so theres an australian stock im planning on buying this week im in the us market i understand theres a commission you pay on top of the price of shares im buying thats well understood but ive tried googling this and get a lot of different answers what are the tax implications when selling such shares i get i pay us taxes in whatever tax bracket im in but if im correct theres another tax for international stocks correct ,DasRedBeard87,2024-11-20 21:46:59,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvt6p6/understanding_tax_implications_for_international/,,"many times ive had oddball foreign stocks i ended up having to waste a lot of life hours doing thankless paperwork or paying obscure fees or taxes  now before purposely owning one i ask myself if i truly believe this one stock is better than thousands of troublefree domestic names and even if it is would all the headaches be worth having this assumed gem making up 3 of port  so theres an australian stock im planning on buying this week im in the us market i understand theres a commission you pay on top of the price of shares im buying thats well understood

if the stock is a foreign ordinary symbol ends in f check first if your broker charges fees some brokerages can charge as high as 50 for trades in foreign ords might be cheaper in that case to buy direct on the foreign exchange via brokers like fidelity  its actually not that hard broker withholds the dividend tax and you declare capital gains with currency exchange rate


if dividends are tiny i usually let go of the tax autodeducted by the broker and dont bother to claim any difference back  thats one scenario out of many but hey go for if you believe one australian stock is better than every other domestic one",0.5499,0.8811,1

we are not the same  target now materially losing to wmt if i was a shareholder id be concerned looking on im not compelled  they lowered prices on thousands of items and it didnt work cornell was so beloved for a while but now probably looks like hes going to go if this keeps up  stock down 20

edit from yesterday wwmt earnings walmart said it gained market share last quarter driven primarily from upperincome households households making more than 100000 a year accounted for 75 of the companys gains httpswwwcnncom20241119investingwalmartstockearningsindexhtml  people locking profit ahead of nvda earning gonna be wild  app is now a 112b market cap company nearly double that of ttd this is euphoria at this point  i still have 3k invested despite all my recent selling will sell another 1k today

looking back at all the stocks i exited and i gotta say im pretty happy with most of those sell decisions i lost out on 10 upside on aapl 2025 on ufpi 20 on jpm but cvs target apps note the s intc olpx all either went nowhere or crashed and burned even more i learned today a stock i sold for a profit got taken over for basically no premium rcm 

my biggest mistakes have been not selling most of the time celhclfd being one good example eventually exited celh

with my extra cash i dont really know where to put it besides index funds but ill probably add to my new amzn position to get it to full size  telling myself that the responsible thing would be to wait until tomorrow for nvidia reactions to buy more semi equipment  blackstone bought jersey mikea for estimated 8 billion holy shit that is a lot of 20 cheesesteaks  in the year 2024 reddit still cant get its shit together  wondering if i should buy the 20 tgt dip   speculative play ive got but rcat is printing hard on a new contract award seems to have some tailwinds behind it  i bought tgt at the ath as one of my first ever stocks ive been looking to sell it ever since just wanted to break even but im starting to think thats never going to happen  we are all getting to watch mstr and btc be a ponzi scheme in real time its wild

selling stock to raise money to buy bitcoin and they both keep going up together in a feedback loop lmao

gonna be textbooks written about the nonsense that is the 2024 market  my neighbor works for app he prolly wont be my neighbor for long lol   waves from the shore to nvidia as it will probably go higher   apparently every red day for spy is a green day for solar what gives  nu starting to look more appealing im a buyer at 1250  asml getting completely destroyed in european stock markets i am now officially a bag holder lol bought in the 600s as i think this is one of the safer bets for the semiconductor industry for the next 510 years  flex up like 7 this morning on news of joining sp400 midcaps   not 100 clear on this from applovin is this offering more shares to pay off loans so they can be debt free

the offering will be made by means of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec the company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to repay in full its senior secured term loan facility due 2028 and its senior secured term loan facility due 2030 and to the extent of any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes  bought some powl and fn to swing trade this morning   anyone looking at vistry group  thats pretty rough

for announced plans to slash 14 of its european workforce wednesday marking the latest round of layoffs across the continent

the us auto maker will cut 4000 jobs primarily in germany and the uk by the end of 2027 that is equivalent to about 23 of fords global workforce

of particular concern is the health of fords passenger vehicle business in europe where the company has incurred significant losses in recent years ford said in a statement it singled out an industry shift to electric vehicles and heightened competition describing both factors as highly disruptive

the company also unveiled a cut of 3800 european jobs in february 2023 saying it was making a very aggressive move to reduce spending on manufacturing and in its supply chain  costar group on the cre market

from x  mstr is like smci 20  its pretty crazy watching saylor attempt an infinite money glitch in front of everyone


its even crazier that its working


a few more doubles and systemic risk is very real  i bet under the covers its already looking weird



i missed it just hold some underlying as a weird side bet but surely this can only end in tears 


im also not aware if the chain can be updated over time betting on primefactorization as a store of value forever looks more uncertain than ever


unnerving  i had brought up ctri here as another undervalued utility play it is up about 30 in 2 months now it looks like icahn is thinking the same  what is going on with qcom  elf diving 8 in the last 10 minutes on no news  wsm took off today lets ride  so with dr oz set to oversee medicare and medicaid does this portend any unfavorable policy changes for unhcvs both rely on the generosity of the cms in their payment rates well i know cvs does for medicare advantage unclear about unh on the one hand trumps billionaire friends are going on and on about austerity but unclear if they are actually going to try and defund stuff in healthcare

this thing is down 21 on the year  one of the few ai plays to not participate in the rally

last week we had an excellent response to our new ai offerings  i expect this earnings report to result in positive price action  i just cannot believe mstr at some point it has to have a red day this week right  its interesting seeing quantum computing and bitcoin pumping at the same time wouldnt quantum computing destroy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies  looks like the election bump is officially over  widespread layoffs at transmedics expect tmdx to continue the free fall  if experts are expected another great report from nvidia why did the stock drop today  so does the yahoo finance site specifically charts just not work right anymore its been sporadically wonky for a while but the last couple of days has worked less often than not  hello natural gas my little kitten nice to see youve woken from your slumber three weeks late

get through that resistance and stay there you filthy animal  woo hooo target  i uh uh oh oh oooooh  well whatever that cosmetics selloff was triggered my initial buy order for odd so thats a plus well see how this one feels  so i know basically little to nothing about biotech however one name has been showing up in my screener a bunch cprx curious if anyone follows or knows anything about them 

  
thanks  nvda should up that teaser dividend  if tlt finishes below 9060 today which is both the 8day ema and the anchored vwap it will probably continue to decline for the next 45 sessions

spy and qqq rejected the 8day as well and vix is up 10 bad news for those hoping we would break above and recover the gap up i still believe spx will return to the low 6000s and push up to 6100  rotation out of everything and into mstr i maybe need to start getting more ballsy with my shots i have been eyeing mstr on the whole way up and never bought but then again this is exactly what i was thinking during 2021 so who knows  it really is impossible for this thing to stay down v after v after v when you think its going to go down they just rip a v in your face  for anyone wondering how nvidia is down ah look at the tend in their gross margins 

last quarter gross margin was 7515 that was down from the prior quarter of 7835

this quarter gross margin was 746 next quarter guide for gross margin is 73  735

this is not a good trend and shows nvidia is loosing pricing power  nvda revenue and eps big beats 

35b vs 33 est
 81c act vs 75 est  snow bagholders unite  i got 35 what should i invest it in  cni under 200dma on 5yr any thoughts  aiaad looking juicy finally  omab and abnb the only things doing anything good for me thinking about buying more evvty still  whats the rooms view on bayer bayry it looks to be in the area where nobody wants to be caught dead holding the stock which is the traditional best time to open a position  only real ones know that the market moving earnings after the bell is jack  paper company smurfit is up 25 in three weeks  what the heck  why is google taking a dive today  hosting an nvda bbq party in the backyard this afternoon to celebrate their earnings i cant wait there will be about 50 people in attendance  is it time to buy nvidia lol  i loaded up on some collars on my big positions not a bad idea for a maybe toppy market imo  on the same day how can maramstr but 15 riot be unch and hut be 5  anyone else feel dumb not buying mstr a week ago  deleted  pretty darn good chance that any rip by nvda and semis as a group if it happens at all is for selling purposes 


the group as a whole has just been way too weak and i dont think nvda can save them and themselves anymore  anyone have a stop loss set up for nvidia and if so where did you put it im up 400 already and will probably hold unless the results are disastrous at which point i wouldnt mind being prepared 

but i also know the stock can be volatile so if i place one at all it should be at a position that saves my profits but is deep enough that at that point its clear it wont be going back up but this is probably just me being stupid

i know theres no easy way to determine where to put it given  nvidias size and the current market but im curious as to hear your thoughts  who are the idiots selling nvda ahead of its earnings release  app calls and i answer   which is the best space stock to invest for long term if i have 10k rklb lunr or asts  so if i have a relative that wants to give me a lump sum of money to invest in a stock that im currently investing in and they know its a long term stock how would i handle dividing that money when it comes time for selling

again this is my relatives money they know the risks and of course im not gonna steal it but i want to know how to divide the sell whenever that maybe  built different  i like thought it was like a really good like fight like totally  absolutely brutal earnings and comparing it to wmt makes it much worse as a tgt holder this is a bleak earnings report  in typical reddit fashion we had dudes dumpster diving target while amazon costco and walmart sat in plain sight  doesnt really follow target or walmart but isnt walmart more of a grocery business now i want to say they get a ton of revenue from grocery and they actually have a lot of subscribers to their walmart platform 

target really feels like the odd man out in that space   concerning  your stock selection from the start isnt good
aapl tgt intc are damn bad stock  financial report have nothing to cheer about nothing show exponential grow anymore with them

ponzi like mstr easily outperform any bad stock selection

sezl is an example of exponential growth

first principle
1 choose the right stock  many people bought semi equipment makers because they missed the boat on nvda yet here they are underperforming while nvda goes to aths the me too play not working out here  god damn it my favorite restaurants keep either going public or getting bought by private equity the quality always dives afterwards  bounce maybe oversold with a 24 rsi but its been clear for more than a few quarters now that wmt is eating their lunch in a material way  and imo thats even more clear after the good wmt quarter yesterday  brick  mortar retailers are not very good investments you either have to be able to charge very high margins or have exceedingly high volume of footraffic to cover your real estate expenses  walmart will kill all of its big box brick  motar retail competitors just like amazon killed most of its online retail competitors  whats your bull case  dont wish to be political but where i live tgt will never be forgiven for the tuckable incident because they never apologized  they are dead money imo  i didnt pull the trigger end of october after looking at it bummer  thanks for getting this on my radar  lesson i learned early  you dont need to make the money back in the same place you lost it  markets are playing hot potato just sit back and watch the show  its crazy  saylor is trying to be the regulator of an asset thats supposed to be unregulated lol  bitcoin is not a ponzi the 19 apy stable coin offered by binance on the other hand  overvalued because of speculation and a ponzi are very different things is an etf that uses investor money to buy gold a ponzi as well vehicle for buying speculative asset with questionable value is fine we dont have to get dramatic  me and my 34 share canoe hopes you are right  clean energy oversold  tan is up a whole half   my only green position today is arry  im a buyer at 1510

  
we are not the same  waiting for 580 personally i can see it falling even more though  how does this type of action usually impact the stock  does that mean youre expecting it to bounce back quickly or just eventually  jay powell has his own ticker symbol  im closely following it no position yet market is really convinced that the partnership model transition wont work out

the had two big profit warnings in a row because their south division was basically misrepresenting numbers

greg fitzgerald the ceo seems to be capable but he has so many conflicts of interest going on its just ridiculous he is the ceo the chairman of the board the coo old one got fired today owns 40 in baker estates a potential vistry competitor which in turns owns shares in vistry and he owns ardent hire a supplier for vistry

the partnership bear case if probably going to be labor and building materials inflation eating up margins latest changes of the labour government already increased labor costs  i got in it today and it dropped about 5   im admittedly not familiar beyond the surface but tend to be hesitant on undervalued andor talked up real estate plays will take a look but it feels like for every joe that eventually succeeds theres half a dozen hhhs where ive read endless sum of the parts thesis reports and yet its below where it was a decade ago  or something like trc which people thought was cheap 15 years ago and its down about a third from there

good luck if youre long  built ford rough  they scammed my workplace sold us a fleet of ford mustangs that still do not work years later  my thought is that residential rents have been shooting up not just because of costs but also because a lot of these property groups are in distress with their leveraged debt  im always tempted to short it but have been burned with bad timing in the past  what are you reffering to  thoughts on smci  i wonder if this is related to the movement

qcom set out new targets at an investors day on tuesday perhaps the most eyecatching was targeting revenue of 4 billion from its personalcomputer business by 2029 laying down a challenge to amd and intc httpswwwbarronscommarketdatastocksintcmodarticle_chiclet

that represents a little over 10 of the estimated size of the total chip market in windowsbased notebooks and desktop computers qualcomms chief financial officer akash palkhiwala told barrons in an interview on wednesday

if you look at what happened in macs apple took their phone chip supersized it and put in a pc and the performance was outstandingwe are doing the same for the windows ecosystem palkhiwala said



its an ambitious plan but will likely need to be to make up for the expected loss of revenue from apple qualcomm currently builds the modem chips that the iphone maker uses in its smartphones qualcomm previously signed a contract to supply apple with 5g chips for its iphone launches until 2026 but is still expected to eventually lose a large part of the business to apples inhouse chips

we continue to have confidence in ceo amons ability to move qualcomm beyond a modem and cellular ip company to become a true broadbased semis player that said if there was one knock we think the loss of apple will weigh until 2027 wrote susquehanna analyst christopher rolland in a research note  muddy waters is short supposedly dont see the report itself though  i was rooting for hogan as education secretary but it was not meant to be  just love watching all the appointments of people who have never run a large complex organization or even have managerial experience  in other words smash and grab lol thats pretty funny wording  i just watched the ceo on cnbc being interviewed by kelly evans  interesting as they correlated elf imports from  china to revenue

i worked with import data for years and it you do not search correctly tariff code  entity name spelling mistakes location product description you will be misled   in addition the import could be handled by the freight forwarder so you really need to look at entire harmonized code and back calculated

elf could also have a toll manufacturer purchase materials and have them packaged here

i have no position but watching how this plays out  i havent read them i dont own it for reasons unrelated to the business so im a little behind 

your description is almost exactly what i would have expected though  the primary crux of the report is that they see imports go down big but revenue stay the same elf says this is because they changed the way they accept orders saying they accept orders when it ships in china as opposed to when it arrives in the us muddy waters says because imports are down this means they are just straight up lying about revenue profits and forecasts how is this possible ive only read very positive things about the leadership team there a major publicly traded company is going to just straight up lie about their numbers and forward guidance  i just watched the ceo on cnbc being interviewed by kelly evans interesting as they correlated elf imports from china to revenue 

i worked with import data for years and it you do not search correctly tariff code entity name spelling mistakes location product description you will be misled in addition the import could be handled by the freight forwarder so you really need to look at entire harmonized code and back calculated 

elf could also have a toll manufacturer purchase materials and have them packaged here

i have no position but watching how this plays out  thanks for this  happy i listened lol  look at their exec stock sales thats what pisses me off and being from the industry i reckon they have hit the ceiling  the day i buy in it will tank  the sort of computers made by these companies at the moment arent even close to threatening bitcoin so theyre not in any kind of competition were probably a couple of decades away from that bitcoin is also constantly being developed people are aware of the eventual threats and there are ways to make it quantum resistant  shitcos move together whether its cryptocurrency or quantum computing its not like any of these companies has generated any value shitcos rallying because its a bubble nothing more  id say with how weak the semiconductor complex has been theres probably a 90 chance that the unwind by it is going to make you know who cry next year 


its going to be ugly presuming it pans out and it very much will affect the entire market outside of maybe dividend stocks  its a bubble there just arent that many organ transplants total  ill just note for people here that cramer has been saying to sellavoid it  where did you read that i cant find anything on it  if the stock market does anything predictable the algos take advantage and then its no longer predictable  profittaking stocks tend to fall before earnings as the bearish retail investors take their chips off the table  works fine here  doesnt work well on android  natural gas  sexy  drill baby drill isnt going to happen baby  and thats a boon for natural gas prices  

but hey what the hell does this guy know right  muddy waters short report on elf not sure if i am allowed to link it but its on twitter and their website  just briefly looking at the chart looks interesting ill have to read more on it these next couple days  you have a put position whats meant by sessions  2021 was different a lot of junk companies with little to no products were up significantly while right now companies that seem to benefit from trump administration are up big  their pricing power has been obscene for years  it isnt going to stay that way now would seem to be about right for this trend to change  they asked about that and jensen said its due to ramp costs guided mid 70s with blackwell ramped  two data points doesnt make a trend also were talking about ridiculously high margins reducing to slightly lower ridiculously high margins 

maybe a trend will develop but calling this concerning or a trend right now is nonsense honestly  we are so back   almost back in the green at a buy point of 159  a book on investing  some alt coins im sure this will end well  evvty still has me questioning myself its a phenomenal company throwing off gobs of cash and trading at reasonable valuations even if growth slows in 10 years its either going to shred its share count by like 40 or the market will have to give it a higher multiple

yet it just sits there like i realize its not a rocket powered growth story at this point but it still seems unnecessarily cheap at this point  there any platforms in the us that dont charge you for buying shares of evvty annoying having to pay each time buying with schwab  im looking to exit abnb tbh  selling cc on all my shares hoping they get called away  138 im outta there  i believe they are being forced to sell chrome due to their monopoly  either rib eye steak or discounted cupnoodles will the menu be set afterhours  is there a way to short all fifty of yalls portfolio  nothing better to spend your profits on than feeding friends  no way this is a real thing  so i take it im not invited to your 50 person fake party  gonna be a shitshow if the stock tanks tho  cant tell if youre being serious but i am getting more convinced by the day that we are in a simulation  lol  uh thanks for sharing  20b net income this report about 100 yoy growth  what stock is that  never heard of it  bitf not doing great either  i think they will rally more soon but at the same time i think that the competition is quite intense between the miners and profitability is uncertain and depends a lot on electricity price which has been highly unstable in a lot of places mstr is actually the safer play logically  mara just copied mstr with a convertible note offering thats why its ripping  meme energy  this is just after they did a 700mm share offering and tanked like 48 hours ago  its clown show  nope hard pass  nope  i have such bad fomo but i know if i buy it will plummet and ill be holding the bags  not at all  if you cannot prove a libelous statement then dont write it  bruh stop losses r for noobs look into options collar  im hearing rumbles that ai scaling roi on more data and more compute is slowing somewhat and theres been more focus on reasoning time instead for better results there have been recent breakthroughs there and the upside is that its free so there may be a plateau or slight pullback in spend on server gpus the next year as big tech aims to be more cost efficient  me i had 11714 avg  i may buy back later  i am happy   im not however the nervous case has multiple elements that arent far fetched  

its parabolic up  they have delay upon delay of blackwell  breathless reporters are starting to sniff around and see if anyone is actually making money on their massive ai expenditures  their top 8  customers are all actively trying to develop their own chips so they dont have to keep ordering from nvda  there will someday be a shift in bias from learning to inference  nvidias near total market share means theres more room downward on ms than upward  same thing with margins  nvidia valuation is reliant on some whale customers any or all of whom could get whacked by political chaos at any moment

again im not selling into this but the points against it arent really crazy are they

theres others that are more far fetched like people thinking a competitor will surprise with an equivalent performing chip at a fraction of the price or that a quantum computing development will render nvdas ai obsolete overnight  no financial advice but rklb lunr and asts will go up or down  just dont nothing good can come of it  whats the stock  consumers have become increasingly resourceful and strategic on how they shop he said they know deals are out there theyre willing to search for them and theyll wait for the exact right moment to head into our stores or log on to our app  i agree target looks like they just allocate around 15th of their store to grocery items the rest are for household items and nonperishables that we are in no rush to get and most likely be cheaper in amazon grocery is the one that brings in people to the store because we rather get them ourselves or pick it up instore

i used to hold a few tgt around 2022 bought after the dip but ended up selling in a few months because i noticed that no matter what time i go to targets near me it is so emptier compared to walmarts krogers  yes that is why i sold them lol this is a list of my losers mostly not winners some of them like 2 years ago eg intc in the 40s at least on aapl i made a pretty sizeable profit  how is aapl considered a bad stock  semi equip is a different cycle than chips and a lot of chips are very different cycles than ai chips specifically atm  thats a good point   ill throw myself off a tall building before i ever shop at walmart over target  bull case is that no way it goes to zero in a year  20 discount on an established retailer that appears from the outside to be professionally operated i bought a little  i dont even know what that is  dont fall for bullshit right wing propaganda  httpswwwreuterscomarticlefactchecktargetstuckfriendlyswimsuitsareforadultsnotchildrenidusl1n37l2ce  do you have a link to the article that proves they did that of is this one of those immigrants eating pets things again  real estate sugar oil steel is also ponzi almost everything that has a quoted market price can be called ponzi by that logic  mstr is buying btc to pump their stock then they are selling stock to buy more btc and that pumps the stock so they sell more

thats a ponzi  bitcoin has been called a ponzi for 14 years and isnt going anywhere at this point its time for people like the op to just accept it  no clue why csiq is up 5 anyone  yeah technicals are looking ugly right now i went in too early i would now recommend a dca approach

from a fundamental view i agree with the morningstar report that stated it is now priced for the lower end of management estimations through 2030 as they had a very big gap between lower and higher end of estimations i think there is a lot of upside potential with a limited downside risk  im fairly new to it a couple of weeks but noticed it drop somewhat premarket when this article was released the further drop after open appears to be related more to the morning market dump it read to me as a positive thing the stock has been on a tear and paying off debt completely seems like a positivejust wanted to hear thoughts from others ive been a diehard index fund investor my whole career and only recently dabbling into individual companies  both ive been long on powl for a while and it ebbs and flows like that i actually thought it was going to sale off after the earnings since the pattern for a bit has been more of a pop on earnings and then the stock more or less trades flat or down until the next earning report 

same with fn news seems to be related to some fears around a report from briley 

analyst comments we downgrade fabrinet to sell as the unbundling trend of nvdas gpu platforms is expected to negatively impact fns optics business we lower the price target to 178 from 194 applying a cashadjusted pe multiple of 16x previously 17x to our fy26 eps estimate  
  
historically amzn msft and meta have purchased nvidias gpu platforms such as the hgx h100 which include integrated optics supplied by fn via mellanox coherent cohr and innolight however alphabet googl has been an exception purchasing only gpus and assembling its own platforms  
  
our checks suggest amzn is shifting its purchasing model to buy nvidias gpus separately and build its own platforms while this change does not affect nvdas gpu business it impacts its optics business as amzn is a significant customer we believe msft and meta are likely to follow given their existing capabilities to produce gpus and other technologies which could further challenge fns optics business  looks like the swing trades have paid off im up like 14 off powl and 7 of fn  good points i think risk reward looks good at these levels 
im reasonably comfortable with next years inflationary outlook sure labour will creep up due to labours recent interventions not implemented until april 25 and cpi is running at a modest 23 today and i think the impact of both will be marginal in construction if inputs remain consistent lets not forget construction is littered with self employed people who are well paid

vistry shares the burden of inflation with the supply chain this probably means that certain rates are locked in for the year eg theyre unlikely to be exposed to any significant labour inflation it will be similar for plant materials will probably hold the greatest exposure but these are probably locked in instances of low to medium inflation

also theyll reduce exposure as inflation will be incrementally applied throughout the year 

i figure theres upside to this ntav backed market cao even if for some reason the partnerships migration flounders they can just toggle back to traditional house building 

i hold and im at maximum position size  bad luck it may go down to around 550600 imo but its becoming pretty cheap on a forward basis downside is probably limited from here but who knows will probably buy under 600  i know a bunch of pds in my area that bought hybrid explorers and they are universally pieces of shit for what thats worth  mstr insanity  interesting qcom following apples lead to build armriscv laptop chips i wonder if theyll be aiming for chromebook type things or more high end laptops with more sophisticated and powerful chip infrastructure like the m4 in macbooks  thanks for the insight muddy waters has some sources that seem to corroborate their view that nothing materially changed in how elf accepts their imports i would love for the company to release a statement clarifying this asap it should be relatively easy to disprove  what makes bitcoin valuable i understand the technical aspects but gold was valuable because its shiny and rare and used for jewelry i guess us dollars are valuable because the government backs it as being worth a certain amount of goods and services i guess is it the same with bitcoin a lot of countries are against bitcoin though so what gives it its value sorry if this is a dumb question  make bitcoin quantum resistant  how exactly

this seems like a problem that is 1530 years away  calling 20 of the last 3 pullbacks as always aye  tsmc will be able to produce 3nm nodes in the us soon since their current gen has moved on to 2nm apple still heavily uses tsmc 3nm i think it will be fine especially because tariffs or not the companys product will be the best in the world and the most sought after by the biggest wallets in world ie governments and mega cap tech  organ transplants this month are up but you are saying its a bubble what   why would they not drill  ah i love buying a company dragged down by a different companies issues   i know nothing about the sector but the company always pops up when i screen 

i mean the valuation is solid and the performance is good too 

interesting to see if you find anything going to start digging into earning calls and slides soon   i will if it finishes below that level at the end of today

sessions  days when the market is open  seems strange that ramping all their other new high powered ai chips the past few years has not resulted in margin compression like blackwell has  its actually 4 data points which i would say makes a trend 

q2 2024  7835

q3 2024  7515

q4 2024  7457

q3 2025  73  735 guidance

yes its still a very high margin business but a concerning trend nonetheless in my opinion youre fine to disagree  i dont see how its any different from tsla first mover advantage in hardware that had absurd out of norm margins but will fall as demandsupply evens out 

cult stocks will cult though  i think ill sell a good amount tmm and leave a share or two in case it regains its former glory  youre green my friend  this with that money you can buy

the intelligent investor 18 and one up on wallstreet 11 and still have 6 for ice cream  chris mayer clay finck and kyle grieve sold evvty apparently because of overreliance on the asian market lack of transparency geographical profit breakdown not given growth slowing down below threshold georgia strikes not resolved

for me the bull thesis still holds just fine so i keep on increasing my position  probably some of it is the sin stock perception still although i think just being a europe mainlisted stock makes some of these companies trade terribly tbh the fact its below last q now after great numbers is silly to me  i dont think fidelity has a fee or at least its not large  otm calls on ramen  well t  most likely are living inside some sort of freely evolving computer universe simulation  deleted  mara in particular has crazy pricing  it used to be 60 when btc was 60000 it was 40 when btc was 40000 almost kind of correlated

then when btc did its march to 19k mara never synced back up  when btc did recover to previous aths about 67k mara broke 30 but in an instant it was back to 15  the btc move from 50k to 95k has only moved mara from 15 to around 20  theres an argument to be made about a halfening along the way but even if that were accepted at full value its still no longer correlated  because you hate money ive been bearish on crypto for a while but im starting to come around mstr is better than something like ibit because you dont have to pay an expense ratio  oh god im not buying in now if it falls back down in the 350ish range ill bite  im at 113 avg and holding i believe in ai and nvidias ability to remain at the top of that field long term and the value that has for almost every industry really any industry there is probably a good application of ai that we can imagine and with ai we can build the things we imagine faster  why  sounds like hes trying to tease a christmas season boost since they pushed all in on deals for the season but honestly just seems desperate  yup but how many understand that clearly and how many were looking for a nvda by another name  seems a bit extreme your obit would go viral though  yea i usually split my shopping between kroger and target sometimes aldilidl fuck walmart  i am one of those in fuck walmart camp if i cannot find what i need in costco whole foods 99 ranch hmart kroger or randalls i dont need it  20 discount on an established retailer

this assumes yesterdays price was correct and todays is not 

you are paying 20 less than you would have yesterday which might have been 20 too high or 10 too high it takes time to figure that out i remember when people here were buying tgt at 180 claiming they just got a 20 discount because it was at 240 before  they put prominent displays of gender fluid swimsuits in the childrens section some suits brazenly bragged they were tuckable

when parents got angry tgt complained it removed some displays to prevent violence so in essence they painted their own clientele as violent assholes  right so the dozens of videos i saw on twitter with people filming the displays in the chidrens section was just my imagination  and parents definitely did not stop shopping at tgt its just a coincidence their stock price has collapsed since these incidents occurred

so go ahead and buy shares  i mean if you really believe what youre preaching  you can live on real estate you can eat sugar you can burn oil you can build with steel but bitcoin if nobody else wants it well  its definitely a scheme more like trying to corner a commodity than a ponzi to me  its not really all that different than any stock you are just buying leveraged btc at this stage  bitcoin isnt a ponzi but mstr is definitely a pyramid scheme  btc isnt a ponzi its just an overvalued speculative asset

my personal view is that btc is an insane waste of electricity and at some point in history we are gonna look back at it and wonder what the everloving fuck we were doing with it  thanks for the heads up ive got about 15 of my portfolio in it ill take the profits if it starts diving  nice i knew you were long on powl just curious how fast you expect something like that to swing    good points i think risk reward looks good at these levels im reasonably comfortable with next years inflationary outlook sure labour will creep up due to labours recent interventions not implemented until april 25 and cpi is running at a modest 23 today and i think the impact of both will be marginal in construction if inputs remain consistent lets not forget construction is littered with self employed people who are well paid

i dont fully understand the inputs in terms of materials and how inflation is working there at this moment i dont even know the ratio of labor vs materials costs that is maybe something one should look at

vistry managed to force a 10 discountt on all its subcontractors a while ago and they sold it as a win so i guess they have some leverage as they are able to provide a continuous stream of work to them

 vistry shares the burden of inflation with the supply chain this probably means that certain rates are locked in for the year eg theyre unlikely to be exposed to any significant labour inflation it will be similar for plant materials will probably hold the greatest exposure but these are probably locked in instances of low to medium inflation
 
 also theyll reduce exposure as inflation will be incrementally applied throughout the year

looking forward a higher inflation environment will be priced in indeed that is also not a concern of mine im more worried about projects that were launched assuming an optimistic scenario remember they get paid in advance under partnerships so they have to hit the mark or face losses i remember reading something about them also going quite low on some of their bids for projects

 i figure theres upside to this ntav backed market cao even if for some reason the partnerships migration flounders they can just toggle back to traditional house building

vistry is currently trading below book value at less than 8 times evebit that means its basically treated as a runofthemill homebuilder once the company manages to demonstrate that their partnership works and their roce goes to the moon to levels of countryside it will rerate for sure the bull thesis is quite clear here its now all about managing the downside figuring out how the whole thing could still fall apart

 
 i hold and im at maximum position size

did you buy on this dip or are you an older shareholder  they been doing that for a while in fact arm and qcom have had some lawsuit issues recently 

httpswwwforbescomsitespatrickmoorhead20241107qualcommandarmtradejabsaheadofdecembercourtcasehttpswwwforbescomsitespatrickmoorhead20241107qualcommandarmtradejabsaheadofdecembercourtcase

qcom has been wanted to get into the pcserver chip business for a bit its actually what the lawsuit is about 

but then in 2021 qualcomm bought a chipdesign company called nuvia which had its own license agreement with arm a key issue at stake in the upcoming court case is whether qualcomm thus automatically acquired the rights to use nuvia cpu designs that incorporate arm ip qualcomm believes so and has acted on that basis conversely arms position is that the arm architecture license with nuvia was not transferable without arms permissionsomething it could use to trigger a renegotiation of the license on financial terms more favorable to arm  its basically the network effect in an asset if enough people believe then its real and valuable if there is increasing demand for something on a limited supply then the price will go up also as the dollar continues to inflate and devalue the btcusd price will continue to go up i personally have stayed away from crypto but thats how i understand it genz seems to be very into it so it could have a lasting effect we havent seen a significant crypto winter in quite some time it will be interesting to see what happens ifwhen that occurs  gold was valuable because its shiny and rare and used for jewelry

bitcoin is also rare and useful  its essentially due to it being unhackable and decentralised these two things are simple but very powerful pretty much entirely secure no hacker or super advanced ai will be able to breach it it has the potential to outlive nations and centralized currencies and its price is based on supply and demand in the most transparent way possible with clear set limits and largely grass roots initial distribution yes people will try to manipulate the price and profit from it like anything but the core economics of it have a beautiful simplicity and purity to it i think this is important more in the longer term sense of a trust and transparency in the working of the system

what the other guy said about it being valuable because people believe it to be valuable is something that people say who have decided to form a closed opinion on it before looking into it at all its true in a sense but the same is true about anything we assign value to and is not the actual specific reason bitcoin has value but just a general statement about humans and value  bitcoin is essential and irreplaceable by any atom known in the universe for peak electronic conductivity in critical computer circuits and interconnects  oh wait sorry no im thinking of gold not bitcoin  removed  cool information but that doesnt change that the soxx chart looks absolutely awful and in the most likely case the chart is gonna win 


taiwan semi in particular since you named it is probably good 10 year buy but over the next 12 months it retracing to 150ish wouldnt be a shocker  yah a bubble that popped at 175  gotcha what strike and date are you targeting if you find mind sharing  imma go with what the ceo said bruh  yes just about but not a very compelling or worrying one how about the data points before this  i suppose things will even out at some point and competition will increase a lot especially when big technical hurdles get reached that difficult to improve past just didnt think we were that close yet but really need to look into this stuff more even though not invested in nvda 

maybe amd can take market share from them soon i guess that alone could hurt them a decent bit at this point are there any other real players though  best money youll ever spend  or be foolish and lose it precisely like i did  i hadnt heard chris mayer sold it where did you hear that  the numbers were great but bolstered by a few one time items that made them look better is say they were good earnings 

i agree with the sin stock and european ideas too also i think there are fears over the european tax increases which i believe hits their balance sheet next year 

either way i think its a solid long term hold  idk if you meant to responding me but i dont understand your comment i am not permabull i dont even own nvda  i just found their comment to be funny and surreal nothing to do with nvda itself  you cant look at stock price u need to look at mkt cap because these shtty miners dilute so much  mara at 24 now is like 60 back in 2021  yeah youre just paying a 200 premium to holdings way better  i couldnt care less about crypto  always another play out there  why would you want to do this take a step back and think it through best case the investment does well and now youre dealing with taxes logistics and awkward conversations about what they owe you if anything worst case it loses value and youre the one they blame potentially tarnishing your relationship either way youre taking on all the risk and stress with little to no upside for yourself if they want help opening their own brokerage account sure help thembut investing on their behalf is a headache at best waiting to happen whats in it for you  true i suppose my nvda proxies have been avgo cls anet and pstg which has worked out decently but would have been easier to just own nvda lol  right im a retail trader and i do the best i can with very limited information a 20 discount on a large and established business is a lot more enticing than a 20 discount on a lightly traded stock or a memecoin  i remember that

1 there were no tuckable items marketed at children or in the childrens section that was a lie promoted by the far right 

2 customers were actually engaging in threatening behavior  and crickets   how predictable  if nobody wants it it goes to zero but that is not what a ponzi scheme is  so the fiat currency sitting in my digital bank account is also part of a ponzi scheme  please explain how it is leveraged  thanks for confirming that were still early in this cycle when normies like you keep fudding  yeah it was an odd reaction to the report i dont believe trends always work but owning the company for a while normally it pops off earnings and then trades flat or down until the next quarter 

this time it ran heavy into earnings and i figured it would trade down 

i opened a new account recently with 500 of fun money to see how much i can make from it same with fn im long on them and price drop seemed like a way overreaction to the news  yeah i knew they were kind of bogged down with an arm lawsuit for awhile so i figured they havent gotten into laptops yet id expect the royaltylicense issue to get resolved pretty quickly potentially with an out of court settlement too much for both of them to lose if it goes fully to one or the other side given their codependent relationship  thanks i read the article on investopedia it seems like a big advantage of bitcoin is that it is resistant to the moneyprinting process and other inflationary factors that governments cause   we havent seen a significant crypto winter in quite some time 

going from 69k to 15k was enough winter  theres a lot of names in the semiconductor industry that are not anywhere near as good a growth option as tsmc and heavily weigh down soxx when compared to the individual company tbf i tend to pick stocks over etfs if theres a dip to 150 im definitely buying more i got in last year so im up about 60 so a dip would still be beating sp which is my goal i dont see tech becoming less prevalent  remindme 1 year  december 13th expiration 91 strike  prob a smart move wasnt trying to advise anyone to sell their stock or make any financial decisions was just advising of a trend i noticed in the gross margins pointing out thats why the stock may be down in after hours 

but as usual pointing out anything even remotely bearish during a euphoric market gets downvotes lol all good i think regardless of what the ceo says its still good and prudent to review all the data and take everything into consideration before drawing your own conclusions on where you want to invest your money  the data points before this they were increasing margins were expanding and thats when i was buying i still own shares in nvidia and i wont be selling but im definitely not buying more shares now the margins have clearly peaked in this cycle and are now declining  lets just say these are still rumours at this point if you want to believe these rumours he also sold odfl for sure what is public is that chris said he is building a new position in a vms company see his twitter  what about an etfstock that im not involved with would that be less complicated like i have voo in brokerage and vt in roth can i just dump it in vt in brokerage and leave that for them  i see its for my parents its their lump sum and they just wanted me to put it in for them but yeah i see what you mean  i think one of my biggest flaws as an investor is to try to be contrarian if i see something going up big i try to find a diamond in the rough some sort of alternative that people are overlooking but usually youre better off just following the masses on these trades aka i bought amd instead of nvda at the start of the ai run  right but decline  discount necessarily theres a really large amount of information out there for retail for free im also retail  that ponzi scheme is backed by the military and the power of legal violence  think of it like using 5 to get exposure to 15 worth of bitcoin because mstr borrowed the extra 10 at least thats how the mstr buyers are thinking of it they are also thinking that mstr can keep borrowing money and pumping btc 

its still insanely risky but so is all leveraged trading  yeah that definitely makes sense i like your fun money account idea seems like a good way to test your instincts without risking too much 

i had a small position in powl from last year i assume hearing about it from you its more than tripled since then and i feel awkward about holding even though its still in a good position   yeah i think qcom is like one the biggest customers and the ceo of qcom was one of the people who talked about just having the industry names come together to just buy arm since it seems a lot of moving towards that architecture 

i think a lot of the price movement today is from the investor day and apple news  meh i think its fine to quote them as a group because they have all had terrible price action


the ai semis have held up better but other than nvda they seem to be holding on for dear life for the most part  i will be messaging you in 1 year on 20251121 230820 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202511212023082020utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1gvmifmrstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_nov_20_2024lybr45mcontext3

  lol ill set one too in case its still trash

remindme 1 year  thats fair i dont see it as something to be concerned about but at the same time i dont think its a compelling buy right now there were positives too trading flat makes sense to me its very slightly down now  not sure why you would want to take a cut of this anyway its all theirs if you want to help help if you want to get paid get a job if you think they should pay they should be paying someone who doesnt need to ask reddit questions because they have the necessary education and experience to make decisions themselves  but the buyers are really using 15 to get 5 of btc  one thing ive learned over the years is take profit i like the approach of just taking out your initial investment and letting the rest run its just house money at that point 

like i made that mistake with smci not to be that guy but i was like one of the first people really talking about them here when it was like 90 i sold out after doubling but the stock continued to run 

dont get me wrong i try to be transparent im a software engineer and know the basics with investing so by no means a pro ive also recommended some bad names as well but thats another thing ive learned over the years winner out weight your losers 

yeah the fun money idea was just a way to swing trade and have fun in the market thats one thing that people forget sometimes like you can treat investing like hobby its been a bit of a bull market but started the account on oct 25 and im up now up to 831 dollars its also something where if i lose it all im still fine for my financial situation  funnily enough of the group i only have tsmc and nvda  im just a sucker for the big names probably which may not be great long term short term its been ok",0.765,1.0,1
"Exciting times for space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks!","space nuclear and quantum computing stocks are ripping and roaring there are lot of small to mid cap companies in these industries that could one day be mega cap companies  picking the correct ones is the hard part 

would love to hear everyones favorite companies in these three sectors supported by a little explanation as to why you think they have a bright future 

i am particularly excited about these three industries because i believe the number of satellites in orbit will grow significantly in the next 10 years i am optimistic that smr nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years and i believe quantum computing is finally here and real world applications are popping up every day 

my personal picks for these three categories are rdw oklo and ionq let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options i have a small stake in all three 

apreciate the responses

edit well now it has 0 

also these stocks are giving me ptsd to 2020 ev stocks  i am all in on rklb i am just hoping for some correction so i can buy more lol started buying back in july currently at 420 shares and plan to buy many more for the next few years

i am also looking into lunr and redwire but not too sure on them at these levels i may go into redwire due to the smaller market cap but will see

open to suggestions for quantum and nuclear stocks  besides a spread between gsat asts lunr rklb ionq i have also a position in aspi which will start to produce haleu fuel for nuclear reactors this is currently only developed in russia so besides the need for more fuel theres also from the west a security sentiment  oklo is crazy volatile but im in rigetti and ionq basically going straight past lamborghini into bugatti  the sleeping giant is mda space from canada one of the few space companies that are profitable and its going under the radar because its on the canadian stock market  just made 400 off rocket labs lol unfortunately it was only like 300 that i initially put it sold it only because i feel its overvalued atm due to wsb lol ill get in again after it comes down a bit  loving my cameco rn  check out bwxt does anyone know about this company   these 3 themes were very high on my list and ive been adding to each for a while  i havent diversified as much but primarily stuck with rklb uec and qbts  may look to add other companies if i find a opportunistic dip but im quite happy with these 3 as my core picks in the 3 sectors you named  space  rklb a clear leader in the space market alongside spacex international market is another huge growth area compliments spacex for smaller loads would like to buy spacex as they launch ipo

nuclear  ccj is emerging as a leader in nuclear race regardless who runs reactors i also own ura to catch on the rest of nuclear sphere

quantum  i think nvda is the name benefiting indirectly and directly  here are my picks for space and quantum stocks quantum stocks got hit pretty hard yesterday nows a good time to hop in if you havent yet

also adding to this we are still early on lunr rklb asts etc dont let the recent gains sway you from jumping in these stocks have a long way to go and the upside looks huge nasa has taken the stance of allowing private companies to bid on their missions their whole initiative right now is to stimulate growth and stir a lunar economy for the private and public sector 

the reality is here we are literally going to the moon lunr has a mission planned in february i expect to see a steady creep up in price and another big jump as they have a successful mission in february others should follow along the same path space stocks are a great long play i am holding until retirement good luck out there fellas  bn for the win   quantum iona and riggeti 
space rklb 
nuclear  oklo  i have shares and leaps for rklb and rdw rdw more calls out 6 mn as fidelity didnt have leaps



made a pretty decent return so far cashed out my 7 and 10 rklb leaps for 300 return and am slowing buying 25 and 30 leaps  for space i have rocket lab and lunar

dont have anything nuclear wise any suggetions

for quantum i have ionq  why quantum computing i get the other ones why they are going up but why quantum computing at this moment  i been tracking ionq since before their ipo so def invested there  especially when it dropped into the 35 range  oklo
ill enter if i see a major pullback  is there an etf with these or many of these stocks  cameco is a more established nuclear company and uuu is a smaller nuclear company with a lot of promise  of all the stocks mentioned in this thread gsat has the best chance to become a conglomerate with apples backing by becoming the its telecommunications arm 

and im not just talking iphones arvr headsets watches glasses cars other sensors will not need to rely on a terrestrial network to operate or talk to each other i know people in the telecommunications industry and they see this apples intrusion into their territory as the biggest existential threat in their 100 years of operation 

lunr is still relatively cheap compared to the others who have several billion market valuations the thing about lunr is not their moon landers theyre aiming to be a space communications company by building a constellation around the moon and will likely expand outward over the next decade or two

i am sour on asts and rklb chances asts ran up based on assumptions and analysts reports before the appleglobalstar deal was announced and before the election results where musk will muscle starlink into ubiquity and can afford to undercut them on price until theyre out of business they still need to raise billions to support 90 satellites or however many they need tim farrar a respectable communications guru believes theyll eventually go bankrupt as mnos start to bail on them

rklb is an interesting case its being seen as a proxy to private spacex but the fact of the matter is they make most of their money by selling space systems and not on launches launch providers in the west are going to be dominated by few players namely spacex arian and possibly bezos blue origin they may be fine in the long run but theyre overvalued now because making satellites and space systems is a commodity these days 

oklo and ionq are just too early there are many companies well ahead in terms of small reactors and regulatory approvals than oklo and on quantum computing see what ibm and google are doing on that front  you can have space and nuclear in one stock  rolls royce holdings  for quantum im going rigetti rgti they have us based chip fabs hopefully a future chips act contender  dwave qbts is another quantum company they just fought off delisting without a reverse split  

for space im into rocketlabs rklb and intuitive machines lunr  rklb until q225 orl neutron launches  once lunr lands on the moon and has its moon satellite network up it will be unknown territory  grrr rklb lunr apld  ionq just partnered with nvidia on classical quantum ai similarly nvidia is partnering with google on the same tech next 510 years will be very interesting  save  top  saved  not really individual stocks but i recently parked a bit of money into the vanecks nuclear etf  it is a high risk play it is much more likely to fail than to succeed we have seen this already hundreds of times something becomes fashionable topic related stock go through the roof and then 90 of them go bust some time after  i am surprised people are mentioning oklo more than smr which is not only ahead in development of the smrs but also doesnt have sketchy financial statements and trumps buddy is not on their board  this is how i know its a bubble the hopium levels about generic future technology nobody knows anything about is insane  yup i put all my life savings into asts at 32 it will bounce back soon and easily a 1000share stock within the next 5 years  hate to say it but why not arkx  how is rdw different from rklb  also a rdw fan here it has been treating me quite nice  i invested because theres one down the street from me  insane how well its done  how long would you hold this stock for im new to investing  evsolar and weed baby miss those times  your ev ptsd may be healed in 10 years gotta have a very long time horizon for these kind of growth stocks the ev industry is still in its infancy 

granted some ev companies will not be around in 10 years but some losers will be winners 

like i said its all about picking the right ones  ionq for quantum cameco for nuclear heico for aerospace  how big of a correction would make you buy more im looking for a good moment to jump in  im also big on aspi  will definitely check them out thanks  where do you trade this  did not expect a mda shill a pleasant surprise  second this hate it when good companies  stocks suddenly become in meme stocks such as it happened to rklb sold my position last week too hoping for an upcoming correction to get in again  first rule of wsb is to never listen to wsb  i had like 350 in rocket lab and im up like 400 but im not planning on selling i was thinking about putting a stop loss on it but havent and think i might just keep it and see where its at in 5 or 10 years  one of my best trades this year up over 200 on my initial investment  i tend to agree with you but the company is solid and you could just buy the dip when it comes  shhh  rigetti wouldnt be bad to slowly average into  oklo and smr are my 2 nuclear

holding ionq and qtum etf for quantum computing

space i sold rklb like 6 months ago like an idiot  had 1000 shares at a 4 average  aspi for nuclear   people see it as next gen compute but in reality it seems niche from what ive read i think this one is many years away from larger adoption  every time you look for a quantum stock result it collapses  so glad i bought at 3   asts only need 25 satellites revenue will kick in after that we are gaining more mnos week by week we have 500m on hand and are still waiting for 5g or rural fund to hit and we dont need billions of dollars idk where you got that from we only need 1b for the constellation and we alr have half of that on top of the fact that gsat and starlinks are utter dogshit only sms and voice messages asts has actual 5g and thousands of patents  remind me one year  your point on oklo is simply not correct they have the quickest timeline amongst any domestic smr company targeting 2027 you spamming fud on them to drive your puts isnt working well  im not bullish on oklo because of their reactor technology you are correct several companies are further ahead in the development and regulatory approval processes im bullish on oklo because they are also fuel rod manufacturers and are close to nailing recycling spent fuel rods into fuel for its plants especially with the news coming out of russia that they will be limiting uranium exportsrecycling spent fuel rods will be there true money maker  i think of them as a car company  will definitely check this out  i own rycey and heard rumblings about their smr do you really think they can be a major player i know the ceo is trying if they can nail smr an energy stock valuation would be justified imagine a 200 billion dollar evaluation one day lol i dont think its impossible  not true they are actually behind oklo by at least 5 years see my comparison post here last section

httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetssxvw3twsge7  sir youre in a stocks sub we like to get excited about stocks  asts will be bankrupt according to tim farrar and others starlink will crush it apple going with gsat will render it useless on iphones google and verizon are going with skylo good luck trying to sell a service on a small segment of android phones 

dilution is coming too enjoy  because while wood is rich i think she did too much of her own supply personally i wouldnt ever invest in anything ark  rklb works more in the launch aspect of the space economy it provides support for satellite design components launching services and satellite communications i would say they are more like a shipping company rdw works more with the stuff that will be done in space chemical synthesis component manufacturing bioreactors and such both are quite interesting rklb seems to be a more popular trade   in my investing thesis i always hold long term that is i do not plan on selling in the next 30 years unless we get a run up valuation at hundreds of times multiples of projected revenue to be more specific i wont do anything except hold for the next 3 years   its about gambling 

i got lucky and picked a winner and still ate shit relatively 

high valuations based on fluff and hopes of world domination my point is these stocks will probably see a similar fate of poor returns in the midterm  im not sure about the world being around in 10 years but at least you have optimism  maybe at least half of current price but i am going to keep buying regardless probably  i sold off half my shares when it hit 100 gains and sitting on the free ones now not buying more until it establishes some kind of base the bottom could fall out in a hurry if some bad news drops also theyre being propped up by a literal stream of good news drops every day that cant last forever

i do think its a good company for long term hold but whether or not an opportunity to enter comes along remains to be seen 

but thats all just me  same im holding onto aspi  i bought a bunch on a friends recommendation and now im way down i hope you all are right and it goes up  i need the win  ibkr  a broker that allows the purchase of securities traded otc fidelity for example  whyd you sell purely because of the wsb exposure  exactly now onto the next stock before wsb gets into it my biggest one is currently gsat they just announced a reverse stock split  since its joining the nasdaq  same most of my shares are around 6509 range content with the  i own now and will park on it for 10 years or so  i do intend on doing that but for now ive allocated my funds to a few other interests within the market ill buy some again once that dip comes  hear hear  all hype none of this is true management is lying to you asts hasnt demonstrated anything yet not at scale mnos are fickle and they all rushed to sign up with asts because they dont want to work with starlink whom they also see as an existential threat and did not anticipate apple will go its way 

youre showing your ignorance by talking about sms and voice apple has one of the top satellite engineering groups in the world working on this since 20172018 they will blow everyones mind out of the water once they reveal theyre not hype artists like avellan who just build a big fucking antenna in the sky it will all become clearer in late 2025 and 2026 when mnos start bailing out one by one  i will be messaging you in 1 year on 20251120 000419 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi202511202000041920utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1gv0dexexciting_times_for_space_nuclear_and_quantumly0min7context3

  i think theyre blowing smoke into everyones ass with their timelines it will not happen why would google go with kairos why would amazon go with xenergy  hes not correct which company has a quicker timeline to deploy within the united states  they have nothing to do with the car brand hehe  nuscale revealed in the last earnings call that they already are building their first smrs and afaik the design is licensed i never heard about any problems with the plant but i thought plant design and build was another company nu scale just provides the reactor and that is being built right now  this is definitely an opinion lol  i will be holding even if it goes down to 1 or 1 cent per share idc i will keep buying more when i can also please do more dilution so they have more money for business expenses i would absolutely love that  not at all basically to cover up from upcoming volatility and price swings due the hype in the trending stock a lot of people mostly swing traders that thought that they missed the party are getting in now and they will eventually massively sell off producing a price drop im just waiting for that moment to come lets see  i have gsat as well  get ready for the ride  might be worth selling at least some for the time being until the current pump dies  rocket labs isnt necessarily hugely overvalued but the ceo isnt much of a talker and contracts take time to complete for space agencies i wouldnt be surprised to see a steady dip back to 10 or so in the next 12 months and then another big pump as exponential growth kicks in 

either way youre in the money imo  good luck with your investments   and elon can maybe get govt funding away from us but thats really still not too big of a concern considering we only need 25 sats in the air to start making revenue ill be back in 2027 sitting w 250 per share  none of this is of concern our sats were literally just confirmed to be working and operational 2 mnos didnt  just aimlessly rush to pick asts because they are anti elon thats not true at all  and we are still the only company to do a 5g call from space without a stupid dish like elons apple partnering with gsat is literally just for sms texting their tech is unknown no one is close to achieving what asts has achieved so i dont know what you mean by me being ignorant you really dont know what you are talking about our only concern is being delayed and going with blue origin  by that logic every other competitor is not doing that with their publicly available timelines just them

secondly you are asking why the tech giants are not signing deals with oklo who has altman as the chairman obviously they know that openai with their massive data center needs would be first in line and they would be an afterthought its a game of securing early 11 partnerships where you are the biggest game in town with that energy producer altman has that locked in with oklo via the relationship even being that an loimou hasnt materialized yet  smr they are the only smr design that even has regulatory approval so far im putting my money on smr based on the opinion they will probably be first to commercial market with their reactor design  id also bet that westinghouse will have their smr built before oklo  let me clarify im talking about domestic timelines here in the usa are you referring to africa and europe being that the us will be the home of massive ai data centers to support future ai growth firstmover advantage in the us will be huge  i love your enthusiasm  i dunno i think its best to invest in a company rather then dip in and out because of what might or might not happen with market forces it isnt rklbs fault peter becks fault adam spices fault that the stock trended on wsb it doesnt change the fundamentals of the company the minute i start allowing my investment decisions be influenced by whats on the wsb thats when ill know this malarkey isnt for me  can you tell me a bit more about gsat  assuming we are still here ill follow up because i gots me some asts as well  its ok let people have their uninformed opinions meanwhile im loading up on asts  why are you saying we as though you work for asts or own a controlling interest just curious not a dig  not correct nuscale is targeting 2030s because their customers still have to apply for a construction and operating license 2436 months which requires fuel and wont be initiated for a while oklo is submitting a combined cola design construction and operating next year and targeting 2027 for their first reactor to come online and already has fuel awarded by doe oklo is ahead by a good 45 years for this reason

i had a post comparing timelines here httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetssx1nh7q8uvs  westinghouse is projecting 2030s for their ap300 deployment so much later  yes i am referring to usa and i agree with your point
httpswwwnrcgovreactorsnewreactorssmrlicensingactivitiesnuscalehtml

httpswwwnuscalepowercomennewspressreleases2023standardpowerchoosesnuscalesapprovedsmrtechnologyandentra1energytoenergizedatacenters

the second link is a years old showing how far ahead are they to diversify the risk of who actually will get ocer the line first i also own oklo and others but the biggest position in nuclear i have is smr so i really value this discussion we have here  i prefer the term discipline a key behavior when it comes to investing but yes some enthusiasm is present for sure  you follow the trends of intelligent ceos and wsb follows the trends of unintelligent gamblers both influence the market

having your finger on the pulse is the real smart move wsb is gonna dump rocket labs and move onto some other nonsense and you can sell during this hike and buy again after the dump totally up to you  this is the official description of what globalstar is all about

globalstar empowers its customers to connect transmit and communicate in smarter ways  easily quickly securely and affordably  offering reliable satellite and terrestrial connectivity services as an international telecom infrastructure provider the companys low earth orbit leo satellite constellation ensures secure data transmission for connecting and protecting assets transmitting critical operational data and saving lives for consumers businesses and government agencies across the globe globalstars terrestrial spectrum band 53 and its 5g variant n53 offer carriers cable companies and system integrators a versatile fully licensed channel for private networks with a growing ecosystem to improve customer wireless connectivity while globalstars xcom ran product offers significant capacity gains in dense wireless deployments in addition to spot gps messengers globalstar offers nextgeneration internet of things iot hardware and software products for efficiently tracking and monitoring assets processing smart data at the edge and managing analytics with cloudbased telematics solutions to drive safety productivity and profitability

as i have read in some other articles globalstar is part of apples emergency response feature for sos and rescue operations  apple probably will never let them fail so they have support but they are also creating a satellite network to deploy for communities in the developing world to bring internet and communication services for the public government and defense sectors  we as us holders who are holding till full constellation  how is this a question lol  nuscale doesnt have any construction or operating licenses you are only pointing to their design certification in order for their customer to obtain those it requires a 2436 month nrc review period that has not been initiated yet this is why your second link is projecting deployment in 2029 read the subheader which is two years behind oklo 2027 target and thats probably being optimistic well have a better idea once their customers actually start the nrc review for those

the reason why oklo is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a cola which seeks approval for design construction and operating only taking them 24 months compare this to nuscale where every customer needs to create and submit detailed plans then wait 2436 months for build and operating licenses   life savings

 discipline

are you sure about that  thanks  interesting insight thanks

what seems off for me here is why woudnt nuscale go for cola then from their website i understand that entra1 is the company that constructs and operates the reactor nuscale is only manufacturing and their product is licensed 

i might have to rebalance based on what you said though do you have any sources that can help me to understand nuclear laws in usa more  discipline because its in a proper stock that will make me money if i put it in a stock that was akin to gambling such as microstrategy or video game store then that would not be discipline  you bet good discussion for sure

its a strategic choice by nuscale and nano nuclear to sell designs only and not be an owner and operator like oklo they would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves which does come with additional hurdles and liability but allows for much faster scaling

recently the nrc released a white paper stating that once oklo has the reference first application approved it would only take as little as 7 months to get approval on subsequent applications or new site builds which further accelerates the timelines

id recommend the subreddit roklostock im a moderator over there and we discuss many smrrelated topics not only oklo  thank you ill definitely head over there to see what people are thinking

i just saw on wikipedia that oklo had the cola application rejected  in 2022 is there much that changed since then and isnt that worrying for you  nrc said that the rejection in 2022 was without prejudice and based on a lack of case studies provided since mays spac they are in a much better cash and staffing position and have been preparing for resubmission during q1q2 of next year im confident that they will gain acceptance and deploy in 2027 not to mention that oklos board member chris wright was just selected by trump to be the secretary of energy they stand to greatly benefit from further regulatory streamlining and cutting of red tape theres always executional risk here but im confident in their leadership team",0.967,0.9999,1
"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","hello friends i hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday this is a long analysis with a position at the end i will discuss palantir and its recent explosion in share price as well as their current earnings multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value i recognize that this is r investing and thus short selling is not within everyones risk profile i hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir

so heres something you may have read somewhere palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy right since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason im not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right they showed strong revenue growth increasing margins they turned gaap profitable last year a major milestone and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward it is obviously a company that for the right price you want to be a part of

key phrase for the right price i am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation but i would like to make a case for palantir being overvalued in fact the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated palantirs stock is

for starters lets take into consideration palantirs enterprise value despite the stock price rising roughly 50 versus its 2021 peak palantirs enterprise value has ballooned much more

2021 peak enterprise value 60b at around 37 per share  
17112024 enterprise value 146b at around 64 per share

this is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding in december 2020 palantir had 978m shares outstanding this has risen to 22 billion as of their most recent filing while palantirs growth has certainly been impressive it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count their revenue per share metrics have been the following

end of 2020 112  
2021 080  
2022 092  
2023 104  
ltm 119 

palantir has only recently recaptured its revenuepershare number that it had by the end of 2020 this is not necessarily a bad thing but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived growth stock yes revenue is increasing  but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase as a shareholder your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth

likewise their profitability can also paint a distorted picture palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings if it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture you better believe karp  co will do so many of palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the nongaap numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag but one of the most overlooked aspects i found is that of interest income palantir has a massive cash balance gained through dilution  shocker i know that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income this is of course nothing new lots of companies do this 

but consider this in their last blowout quarter palantir gained 006 of gaap eps this amounts to roughly 150m of net income or about 11000th of their enterprise value of this number 52m or more than one third was interest income this is not a small footnote only 100m of their last quarterly earnings was actual nonadjusted nononsense operating income furthermore they also paid only 78m of taxes on their income this number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate 

and then there is the valuation palantir trades at 55x ev  sales this means that if all of palantirs revenue was aftertax profits and paid out as dividends it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments their current ebit margin is a little over 13 that 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require

a incredible and sustained growth in revenue

b a steadily increasing margin and

c an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

we all remember stock mcnealys sun microsystems ceo iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

at 10 times revenues to give you a 10year payback i have to pay you 100 of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends that assumes i can get that by my shareholders that assumes i have zero cost of goods sold which is very hard for a computer company that assumes zero expenses which is really hard with 39000 employees that assumes i pay no taxes which is very hard and that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal and that assumes with zero rd for the next 10 years i can maintain the current revenue run rate now having done that would any of you like to buy my stock at 64 do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are you dont need any transparency you dont need any footnotes what were you thinking

this is somethine else entirely 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well remember you still need upside its not just about justifying the current stock price its about penciling out enough upside in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time 

on friday the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year tesla bitcoin and palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise palantir added 11 and with this move added another five years of revenue to its elephantsized market cap this shows pretty clearly that palantir is associated with memelike risk assets who knows when the current market cap will reverse its a game of liquidity musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing but one thing is clear their current ev  ebitda is nearly 400x 

the amount of retail shareholders i see online that are convinced that this will go to 100 amazes me my question is why based on what sure it shoots up 5 a day and this leads everyone to believe its an amazing company but longterm this company has enormous shoes to fill it is currently a penny masquerading as a 100 bill palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due and unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40 annually for a decade and increase their margins to nvidia levels there is only one way this ride will end 

as it stands now all of palantirs equity is in the 5b cash position that they gained through dilution last quarter the company earned 006 of gaap eps of which 002 was interest income and only 004 was operating income aside from the 2 of equity per share all of palantirs 65 share price is based on this 006 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this in the future growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 13rd of gaap eps in interest income their taxes will also go up in the future if this is not a dotcomlevel valuation i do not know what is 

if you currently buy a 10 year bond you will net roughly 45 in interest annually palantirs stock nets you 18  in revenue 

all of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity thus i am short for now using graniteshares 3x palantir 3spa the leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time thus i will look to acquire longdated puts this week could get smoked some more but thats what makes a market

happy investing",Illustrious_Beach,2024-11-20 01:34:07,75,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv6hj0/palantir_short_thesis_and_an_analysis_of_its/,,"palantir has been funny to watch when it was under 10 reddit hated it and didnt wanna touch it i made some decent small money trading some calls wish i had held longer after selling my calls i bought 100 shares at 20 i recently sold a cc for 60 because after seeing it run 10x in under 2 years im strongly expecting a pullback but the shifting sentiment ive seen here has been very interesting to watch  its objectively overvalued but people have always been willing to pay a large premium for 1 of 1 companies amazon has always traded at a premium tesla has always traded at a premium costco has always traded at a premium ferrari has always traded at a premium crowdstrike has always traded at a premium 

hope it falls in the short term and you make money but in the long 10 year outlook this is a 300 stock thats worth accumulating at any price  nothing that deals with tech is priced properly all kinds of companies with negative pe and eps that are astronomical people swore tesla would plummet and it did the inverse at a fast clip people want to believe so the money goes where beliefs are strong pltr will probably hit 80 by christmas if i had to guess unless some dire news hits no matter how bulletproof your thesis is you cant dissuade market sentiment  something about the stock market staying irrational longer that something solvent  yep im going to share a trick with you though heres a good way to make money dont short stuff 

never take trades where the odds are against you stocks rise more than they fall look for good longs

if you do decide you want to trade against the odds and this one i guess is a fairly reasonable candidate just because of the chart if you use options youre on the clock so thats one more thing working against you also another rule you should never break never buy options always sell them so lets just assume youre going to short shares if you short 63 your stop would be at 67 on a daily close not an intra day penetration theres not really a clear target to the downside though maybe 52 but look how much easier this was for the people on the upside all you have to do is throw a rock at the chart and hold on for you to make money you have to have your timing right and you have to have a very clear profit target with absolutely no guarantee of that being hit in fact the way the moving averages and the chart are pointing youre most likely to be stopped out still youre only risking 4 to potentially make 10 provided the stock doesnt gap up on you like it has many times before i dont think theres any near term catalysts but you also dont know when the next bank is going to give it an upgrade and pop it up 5 for the day  op i had a similar sentiment with nvda

now here is something else to contemplate half of pltr shares are with institutions pension funds etc iow held long term

on november 26 they will be trading on the nasdaq and likely joining the nasdaq 100 which will create even more interest in the shares

recent corrections were minor 

i wont be surprised if it hits 75 soon

personally im in it long term  since i see a huge and stable business here here where customers are locked in long term
now add gov contacts

one more thing i agree with another poster that it was interesting to watch people slam the stock below 10 vs the strong momentum we see now  would you pay 50 times 2028 earnings for a company with high revenue growth and faang like margins in a massive secular trend thats compared to the internet if you believe ai is real then analyst estimates are too low and that warps your view just a thought not advice  same post that was on wsb yesterday 

with how much work you did to write that out you could have spent some time projecting pltrs revenue for the next 5 years and giving your estimate for margins then discounted that back to 2024 and give a pe range it should trade at

no one will argue that pltr is overvalued right now but one of the main reasons it is trading at a high premium is the rule of 40 score is at 68 in q3 

just a year ago the narrative was pltr is only profitable because of interest income now it is interest makes up 33 of income

here is what i care about karp continues to say they have more demand then they can handle and the amount of time per employee to get customers setup is becoming much faster so customer count will be going up faster

i would not tell anyone to buy at the current price but i am not selling any shares even if i think it can dip back down to 45 i also would say not to short pltr until there is confirmation of bearish candle pattern if pltr ended today lower then the open that would have been a bear pattern 

pltr is a solid company that will grow big into the future  counterpoint i opened a small short position today so expect it moon through the end of the year   i appreciate this read and can i say i definitely learned more about the company however id like to ask about one specific metric you harp on a lot 55x ev  sales doesnt really seem that bad compared to other glorified tech companies nvda is at 3544 and is considered to still be value at its current valuation in a vacuum what makes that 55x evsales number so terrible considering their growth and expectations   their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag


at least on this note wasnt the compensation supposed to stop tapering off around now karp discussed this back around the ipo iirc and everyone basically ignored it


the company has undergone massive dilution but the bulk of that should be coming to an end now  the market can stay irrational longer than bears can stay solvent  one thing ive learned since meme stocks became a thing is that you might be 100 right but the stock market doesnt care about your analysis  i should stop listening to posts that have smart words like thesis and instead listen to the guy who bought calls on snow because its winter  meh ill keep dcaing every month see you in 10 years  since when was the stock market rational its a hype stock in line with current ai narratives thats all that matters  sold my lot at 62 yesterday been burned enough times before not making that mistake again  100 agree with all your points i was a pltr long until around 50 and now i have some long dated puts because the valuation has been quite insane  just be careful if you planning on making an earnings play  good thesis  its a good short bet just based on its pattern of shooting up them falling back down  it follows a bitcoin type pattern if you watch it over time  meteoric rise followed by a crash back down to just sit at the same price for awhile followed by another meteoric rise higher than the last rinse repeat    
this is not the complete picture 

in december 2020 palantir had 978m shares outstanding this has risen to 22 billion as of their most recent filing

here is palantirs sec 10k for the fiscal year ending dec 31 2020

page 69 states

as of december 31 2020 there were 1542057292 shares of our class a common stock outstanding 249077252 shares of our class b common stock outstanding and 1005000 shares of our class f common stock outstanding 

palantir ended december 2020 with over 1792 billion shares almost double your claimed amount  

 978 million shares is the weighted average for computing net earningsloss for fy2020 the whole year not just december 
 anyone looking at revenueshare for 2020 would have taken into account massive sbc in that 1st year  from what i remember it was disclosed upfront in the original proxy statement prior to the direct offering  

  
if you want to look at full dilution over the past year refer to the most recent q3 24 10q httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata1321655000132165524000209pltr20240930htmhttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata1321655000132165524000209pltr20240930htm

in millions yoy

2024 2459589

2023 2325600 		

this assumes that all warrants options etc are exercised and all possible shares created 

  
in terms of actual existing shares yoy

2024 2250032 		

2023 2162530 	

thats just over 4 dilution  while significant this is not unusual for a growth company  given that palantirs revenue growth is roughly 27 yoy investors may consider this dilution to be worth the risk  

while i agree that palantir is probably overvalued today and have advised cautionhttpswwwredditcomrpltrcomments1gus824commentlxyqokp to anyone wanting to buy pltr stock at these levels also think it is a disservice to not acknowledge that the sbc situation for palantir in 2020 is much different than the sbc situation today  you will go mad looking at financials financials are a snapshot where it isnot where its going  you must predict where things are going  

many stocks are priced to what they are now but when news hits they go up in value  the whole point of investing is getting in before news hits  before you talk about multiples and valuations you have to start with the product if you dont understand the product you have no basis for making a judgement on growth expectations

every time i try to look at their product i get more confused because it doesnt seem that interesting its a systemdata modeling tool that doesnt seem very hard and is definitely not new i keep poking at it and trying to get somebody to say something interesting that i havent thought of but at best you just get regurgitated talking points from their clownish ceo  how does this take into account peter thiel owning the vp and thus the possible president that seems like a pretty large bull signal to me corruption can you smell it  thanks for the write up

i agree with the analysis but the market will likely need to enter into a true bear market before this one truly breaks down

we shouldnt have to wait too long though  just a couple more rounds of saylor taking pension fund investment to buy more bitcoin   how could that ever go wrong  pltr now needs to grow annual revenue at 30 for 6 years with no change in ev to match msfts current ps ratio msft is a richly valued software company

you dont need to write a whole post just that  we buy high and sell low here  same ive had 5k shares for years now and just sold 500  started buying puts to hedge at some point its going to pullback and that pullback could be brutal

i do believe it deserves a very strong valuation but we are moving into bubble territory now  ive just bought so you will be getting your pullback such is my investing   what strike and expiry did u sell  i agree with the first part of your argument but not the 300 price target im not saying its impossible anything is possible but that would give palantir a 750b market cap they have less than 4b in revenue per year right now even if they grow revenue 50 a year for the next 10 years every single damn year that still wouldnt justify a 750b market cap keep in mind they arent even growing their revenue now at 50 while theyre still small and it becomes harder to do that when you get bigger in the most recent quarter revenue was up 30 yoy very few companies in the history of the stock market have have grown  their revenue at 30 plus a year for a decade  think meta google  again i dont have a problem with you having your opinion i dint think tesla would be at a trillion market cap and here we are but what you say is far from a certainty  exactly  certain companies hold premiums in the market and can be illogical compared to others from a pure numbers perspective  i think this will only increase for palantir now with upcoming nasdaq inclusion and esp as people start to realize the results it delivers to companies who use it  look i own a bunch of 205 crwd and took tons of insults from kids who claimed it was going bankrupt and that i didnt know anything about the cyber  but not sure i would agree its 1 of 1  what is your basis for that claim  pltr doesnt have faang like margins though  pltr has been saying for years that their time to spin up customers is miniscule and they can onboard customers so fast

they said at one point they sucked at sales as they failed to reach the 30 growth projected and even 20 growth at times

now theyre saying they have so many customers they cant even handle them all despite their crazy fast implementation times

and they add what like 100 customers a year the rhetoric doesnt add up for me

i was long pltr i still dont believe its gonna shit the bed and go belly up as a company but i cant justify this valuation and i sold off from 1945 sad i missed some gains but never go broke derisking and taking profits and my other stocks i invested in the meantime are also up 34x so overall i dont think i missed any growth   no one will argue that pltr is overvalued right now

surely you must be joking

there are a ton of people that would dispute that but also would argue pltr is undervalued right now i mean they are wrong and certaintly know nothing about how to value stocks but yeah  counterpoint  i just bought in at 66 expect it to keep on going down the side of the mountain  counter counter point i hold a decent number of shares and hence i will end up losing money in the process it never fails to happen   nvda is at 3544 and is considered to still be value at its current valuation


there is a huge difference between 55 and 3544 evsales ratio if pltr was trading at 35 ratio its stock price would be 36 or so


besides nvidia has achieved a 120 revenue growth for the last year and has a projected 80 revenue growth for next year pltr has a measly 30   of course thiel is first world scvm but we have zero control over the knuckledraggers that worship billionaires the best we can do now is make some of that thiel profit before the civil war starts  reminds me of meta and netflix in 2022  bubbles buy yachts   60 strike for 0925  to be clear if pltr grew revenue at 50 a year then theyd be at 160b revenue in a decade which would absolutely justify a 750b market cap not saying its plausible that 50 revenue growth happens just that it takes far less than 50 growth to justify a 750b market cap if you assume pltr trades at a similar pfcf to other enterprise software vendors like salesforce sap or msft then theyd need 50b revenue to justify 750b market cap which requires 33 growth for a decade

thats still high but ai as a whole is expected to see massive growth as well depending which research firm you choose to believe the ai market will see 2040 annual growth for the next 510 years given that pltr is objectively one of the leading names in the space i dont think its too wild to assume they can sit in the higher end of those estimates or perhaps even temporarily surpass them 

750b sounds like a big number in todays stock market but keep in mind that in 10 years we will almost certainly have companies hovering around 10t valuations and dozens more above 1t at 750b theyd be a comparable size to where salesforce is expected to be a top 30 tech company in the sp500 nowhere near the size of the megacap corporations but doing very well  thats true but the market is trying to discount what palantirs margins will be not what they currently are if you do your homework you can make a compelling case that operating margins could be north of 30 karp even said on an earnings call that the scale ai provides will allow for higher revenue with the same workforce  gotcha i appreciate that clarification would you mind explaining how you got to a stock price of 36 from the different evsales  thanks for the well thought out response youre right it could get there i was mostly trying to point out that 50 yoy growth for a decade is insane like once in generation type growth and maybe palantir is that company and maybe its not only time will tell 33 growth forna decade is also pretty astronomical but more plausible even if it doesnt hit those kinds of numbers its probably still not a bad investment over a decade for example  if we end up at a price of 200 a share instead of 300 thats around a 12 annual return from the current price  it is insane in todays nominal numbers  put inflationary pressure on those numbers which seems to be the choice of good ole usa 750b is small fry  i keep saying this where there is war there is palantir  i wouldnt be surprised if palantir also get involved with doge",0.9997,0.9998,1
"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","new yorktokyo nov 19 reuters  sony 6758t opens new tab is in talks to acquire kadokawa 9468t opens new tab the japanese media powerhouse behind the elden ring game two sources familiar with the matter said as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio

the talks between the two sides are ongoing and if successful a deal could be signed in the coming weeks the sources said

sony already has a 2 stake in kadokawa and a stake in kadokawa controlled fromsoftware the developer of the hit fantasy action roleplaying game

kadokawa is a huge player in japan i would say this is almost the equivalent of disney buying fox in the west theyre not just the parent company behind elden ring theyre a anime manga light novel and magazine publisher they also produce and distribute anime and video games they also have their hands in the music industry 

httpswwwreuterscommarketsdealssonytalksbuymediapowerhousebehindeldenringsourcessay20241119",Slyric_,2024-11-19 22:26:35,92,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv1vyw/sony_is_in_talks_to_buy_kadokawa_media_powerhouse/,,"saying that its just elden ring or fromsoft is vastly underselling it 

its a pretty huge media company it owns a lot of animemanga publishing and studios and a lot more

sony is slowly cornering animemanga market and with how popular it is with the under 30 market and growing it could really pay off in the long run i still think sony buying crunchyroll for a billion is going to be seen as a fantastic deal  not a fan 


more middle managers and vps to answer to destroys creativity   this deal is huge for sony theyre trying to monopolize the anime industry with their recent acquisition of crunchyroll and funimation if this deal goes through acquiring from software is like the little cherry on top especially with microsoft recently acquiring zenimax and actiblizz  as a gamer sad to see it more concordstyle slop on the market is never a good thing  well all we can do is hope not  doing rough napkin math id say the acquisition price could be in the realm of 800b which is some decent upside from the 500b marketcap it closed at lot of risk on this trade though as with any acquisition and im just pulling numbers out of my ass here

would kind of hope the deal falls through as i feel sony would only enshitify kadokawas ip  woah  its not from that sony is eyeing

its anime  fuck sony  thread made me look up sony stock price to find out they did a stock split and i didnt even notice  sony is barely making money with what they have so how is buying more going to make it better

sony thinks it is the competition that is hurting profits and not how they manage what they already have  ugh i hate soul games dont buy it sony you are already in so much debt  think sony buying kadokawa is going to kill the industry   vastly underselling it

 its a pretty huge media company

pointing out that kadokawa are larger than just fromsoftware is good but people are going too far the opposite way and are overselling how big kadokawa is ultimately it has a lot of assets but with a market cap of 32bn those assets are collectively not worth all that much  i think sony has a strong track record of maintaining core philosophies and principles of studios they acquire at least from the game division  god of war bloodborne horizon  i guess the question is does the japanese government mind monopolies  depends on which part of sony theyll be under likely itll be sony pictures or sony music   i dont know i played a little bit of astro bot and it didnt seem very concord like to me maybe i have to play it more  how will this lead to concordstyle slop  using a big bag of money to acquire an already successful company with an established market is very different to trying to make a successful company from the ground up by acquiring successful people and putting them in a room together with a big bag of money

they dont automatically end up at the same place and what sony is doing here is a well trodden path to growing an already massive company  sony eletronics dont make concord phones   could be in the realm of 800b which is some decent upside from the 500b marketcap it closed at

that 500b is after kadokawa popped 22 on this rumour which is unlikely to be the baseline of any negotiation even so 800b is a huge 60 premium on that on yesterdays 409b price its a 95 premium

i dont think sony would go for it on those valuations more realistic its 500b600b  they dont really have a lot of debt

they have a debtequity ratio of 053 an a credit rating and are hitting record profits and part of the reason they have a higher debt load is because of their financial services division which requires a higher debt load than most sectors  when have they ever done that its not an opinion i have ever seen in gaming  fucking up helldizers concord killing tlou2 multiplayer",0.8834,0.9478,1

yup  instant red flag thanks for sharing   ive heard it said that getting the ai ticker was their smartest business move ever  once your company is listed in the stock market you are golden  to be fair rebranding is not uncommon for successful companies thats not a red flag on its own  frequent company name changes are not important

whats important is that it brings returns to investors if it doesnt i dont think anyone will pay attention to it  got some sources  yeah a giant green column lol  lets see what happens next  yeah man youre sensible

its not a crime to change your company name

besides hes really doing ai stuff  congrats dudegifemotefree_emotes_packslightly_smiling  yeah its a company with a lot of potential  soon theyll be called c3p0 with all the new star wars movies soon to come out  listing is not the end of the road companies still have to deal with market pressures shareholder expectations and regulatory challenges  not exactly rebranding if youre entirely switching industries each time energy to iot to ai  yeah its nothing in itself

i dont know why people are so hostilegifemotefree_emotes_packsweat  you are right face book rebranded and became meta no harm no foul  they have been consistently unprofitable for years and are trading at 10x sales and their growth is lackluster 

changing their name to whatever is hot is just a way to manipulate the stock and evidently it works because the stock is trading at nearly 4x its book value even though book value continues to decline as the company reports loss after loss every quarter its a scam  people whove worked there  i dont know where they got the changing name come from its been this name since the ipo the company will definitely be something in the next couple of years they do have alot of customers  not as the founder you take that nut and run or at least care a heck of a lot less sitting on 300mm  thats just the same industry 3 times  well lets use some context behind this terrible example you gave 

 c3ia has changed its name every 75 years since inception each time they have changed its name it has been them trying to enter a new industry that does not give investors confidence if they cant stick to their product by constantly jumping from one popular industry to the next how do you build your moat if you are always jumping to a different industry to chase hype

 meta has changed its name once in 20 years to reflect their more diverse portfolio rather than just their social media platform meta is much more than facebook so they changed their name to reflect more of their business not jumping from one hyped industry to the next they already have a huge moat and name recognition that meta becomes a parent company name like alphabet while the name recognition of facebook continues to be an asset  evidence please  i mean something reputable to read about that aside some reddit comment  s lol  go look at their income statement and balance sheet the information is public",0.9954,0.9911,1
" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?",uber uber technologies has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that donald trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the united states easier to get through presumed from his newfound friendship with elon musk now relatively obviously uber sold off quite a bit on this news but i believe this isnt as bad as the market is making it out to be i believe that uber could easily survive mass adoptions of autonomous vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for uber and see their expenses come down greatly as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers uber currently sits at 410 fcf yield 283 if you factor in sbc and is growing fcfs at over a 100 ytd and revenue 20 ytd this is a rapidly growing company thats priced quite cheaply and i believe that the downfall of uber is greatly exagerated if uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with waymo to be the platform provider i think theyre positioned very well for the adoption of autonomous vehicles would love to hear everybodys thoughts i own no position in uber but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices,werewere223,2024-11-19 23:13:58,35,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv32bn/uber_bright_future_or_dim_outlook/,,"somewhere in the middle  autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off when that happens uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but thats fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own uber can also cleanfix self driving cars but that which would require stations scattered all around is a whole other business vs an asset light app  some talk that uber was interested in expe and perhaps it tries to diversify travel super app

so i think somewhere in the middle i dont think uber goes away by any means but i can see uber looking differentvery different 510 years from now selfdriving on a massive scale is still a long ways off but i do think that itll probably continue to be a cloud over uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 510 years from now on the very short term stock is getting close to oversold  waymo has a partnership agreement using the uber platform uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of waymos vehicles in selected major cities  they have partnership with waymo cruise and other small providers and even if self driving has mass adoption tesla will not be the only player its a matter of time they try to operate on their own and find out its a pain in the ass and would partner with uber to dispatch maintain and also support the ridesits way to complicated to replicate uber and operations whether its self driving or human driven  i own and i believe in the stock it has many markets for growth multiple sources of revenue and i believe that autonomous will not disrupt its platform how others are predicting i think its depressed right now and the concerns are oversold which is when you want to invest in a growth stock

remindme 10 years  mass adoption of autonomous driving is still far out in my opinion even when it becomes a thing one bad incident will cause bad press and concerns for people theres also always going to be people that want an actual human driver

as for uber i think theyll be fine theyre also investing into autonomous driving but also into other streams of revenue i dont own the company but the outlook isnt too dim  uber is oversoldunderboughta buy whatever you wish to call it

in the short and medium term it is a financial powerhouse having turned corner and hitting straightaways on revenues and margins  theyve broken away from the pack like lyft and everyone else  they have diversification  they are international  taxi is fading away uber is the verb for all ride sharing and increasingly food delivery

transportation from a to b isnt a fad that ebbs and wanes and uber is entrenched

their last two ers gave visibility into this power yet other more random and transient factors have driven the recent sell off

the perceived long term threat was from tesla but the manytimesdelayed emperors fashion show that finally happened last month made it clear that uber has several years of safety from that

i see many posts here worried about a futuristic world thats years away  two things one a lot of money gets made waiting for the future to arrive  two big rich incumbents tend to find ways of owning future developments that come along

on that same front waymo is so clearly many years ahead of tesla and uber is already partnered with uber

should the landscape and competitive environment truly change there will time and opportunities to bail in and out as new information indicates


you have to pass through the near future to get to the wildly distant future  uber stock got thrashed on the vaguest rumor of an expe travel merger presumably because their exec used to work there  but it never happened and yet the stock price hasnt reset  i think before we have flying cars and whatever else uber could do things that are more attainable and boring but profitable  instead of flying cars they could invade the logistics space  its a good fit and they have the scale to take share and margin

im a buyer in the 60s with a 90 pt  the stock was 87 recently with no real change in fundamentals since then  i think the travel industry in general is in for a boom once oil plummets  i think they will be fine but just in case i sold my position if it drops further i will consider buying back  i just bought some this morning  we will never know for sure until it plays out but i would agree i think its more likely a positive than negative they already have the logistics set up seems much easier for waymo or other party to use them than to try and do it themselves  short term still a solid player long term i am unsure as companies like waymo cruiseetc are coming on strong to target passengers market food delivery market dont forget about drone which i think also owned by google  if theres only one av player lets say waymo they can probably use their own app the most likely case is therell be multiple av players so one app for each wont make sense uber can consolidate both human and av rides which makes more sense for users id rather have one app than multiple 

their fleet operations play makes it even relevant in the av space waymo has been looking for partners for expansion and uber could be their perfect partner 

this is my bull thesis for uber i own google and started investing in uber now  i bought uber stock about 4 years ago and the main reason wasnt the share ride platform but rather they are working to deliver an autonomous taxi service if anything this is good news 

now granted the grift between elon and our king has already started and i think thatll make uber not the top player but a big player nevertheless  seems like no moat to me

waymo tesla and cruise can make their own app

uber is just a middleman for food and ride sharing

unless uber can get solid long term contracts with every fleet or buy and maintain their own fleet i just dont see it

also lyft seems to be profitable now as well  its 34 pe wouldnt msft be a better bet in tech 


wont speculate about self driving or economic recession discretionary spending but to me uber is no different from what fiverr ebay etsy is for freelancing or physical goods just a middle man between two parties with bad actors undercutting the commissions company in the middle of high friction high risk transaction earning a percentage  skip  they are losing customer trust fast with weird ways they are charging customers based on their regular usage  need of the hr etc  uber is valued at its future growth potential

you have autonomous vehicles replacing humans for taxi service

what do you think 

is it too hard to switch from the uber app to waymo or like is uber a must have so theres no moat cool   good analysis having recently taken my first my waymo i am struggling to see where uber fits into this using the waymo app was almost identical to the uber one in an autonomous future uber becomes the taxi dispatcher and dispatch your ride to waymo zoox or maybe a person i guess   
  
autonomous at scale is a long way off but taking one from phx to the hotel and back it was pretty easy to see a future where dense urban cores and maybe suburbs too are dominated by autonomous ridehailing vehicles and you are right about the asset light pivoting to being the ai mechanics and maintenance isnt going to be playing into ubers core competancies  or uber stays the exact same owners own the self driving cars and uber is the backend keeping everyone in line and skimming off the top and bottom same as airbnb 

im fully invested but i would start a position here   i doubt if google would pay uber when they can very easily add this feature in google maps  i think this would be trivial for google they have their own api for maps uber at the end of the day is an app  a pretty mature one admittedly but google has a truckload of cash and theyve created far more complicated stuff they just didnt want to commit resources to create a new uber and would rather focus on improving and testing self driving tech

so id guess this partnership remains the way it is now its still a win win for both waymo gets to test their tech and not worry about marketing and attracting customers uber gets more profit i dont think it ever was a partnership where one cant live without the other  i will be messaging you in 10 years on 20341119 190638 utchttpwwwwolframalphacominputi203411192019063820utc20to20local20time to remind you of this linkhttpswwwredditcomrstockscomments1gv32bnuber_bright_future_or_dim_outlooklxz1kxlcontext3

  i agree with everything you just said i think its very oversold which is why im looking to enter might be more short term pain which is why i havent pulled the e trigger yet  also agree with this but i dont think autonomous driving is really even a bad thing for uber just think it spooked investors tbh  just because oranjada supports selfdriving cars doesnt mean we have anything better than agvs at the momentand those are rolling on factory floors not the streets this is the same guy who endorsed drinking a dangerous chemical as covid19 treatment because dr oz had stock in the company producing it lets put it this way trusting everything recommended by team orange might lead to some lessthanideal life outcomes  really appreciate the write up and thesis i did end up starting my position all be it small this morning and have enough locked and loaded to dca if i want too i think even if tesla does end up becoming a threat in the long term to their market dominance as you stated uber will have years of uncontested fcf generation at a crazy speed and if they can expand that relationship with waymo they are fully entrenched imo  this is soooo sweet prediction shall we also take a gander at interest rates and usdjpy for next month  oil is not gonna plummet the opposite is more likely  and when do you think thatll happen  mind sharing your thoughts as to why  were in absolutely the same position for context i started my position this morning small only 35 shares so i can dca if i need to but google is my largest holding and i believe this can be a symbiotic relationship and give them both an edge on any tesla autonomous vehicles potentially being pushed out  were in absolutely the same position for context i started my position this morning small only 35 shares so i can dca if i need to but google is my largest holding and i believe this can be a symbiotic relationship and give them both an edge on any tesla autonomous vehicles potentially being pushed out  hmm i personally think theyd be the most successful if they expand that relationship with waymo and use their technology with ubers branding and platform but maybe im bias as im a big google holder lol  i still think people undervalue ubereats  well a middlemen sounds like a good position to be in i find it unlikely google or cruise would want to operate this on their own its more complicated than make your own app  uber has operating leverage microsoft has it only barely meaning a 10 increase in revenue of uber translates to significantly higher earnings vs of microsoft

pe by itself is a bad metric  i thought waymo was actually integrating with uber how was your waymo ride i can see self driving car providers outsourcing the customer facing job of maintaining the tech and payments to a third party to allow them to focus on the cars and that partner will be uber imho  yes but then you need to account for registration maintenance insurance garaging cleaning 247 support  its going to inverse any av news elon news but ultimately those negative sentiments are when you make the best gains eg meta and netflix  to provide more meat afaik selfdriving cars rn are l4 remotlyguided toys that can drive on dedicated lanes good luck making dedicated lanes in nyc for the muskmobile lol  a fed hold would shock the markets but they know were in for a recession so they have to keep power ready which explains why they only cut 25 instead of 50 last time  not unless theres a massive explosion  relatively soon within 6 months for sure  ive been looking at uber for awhile and the recent drop seems like a good opportunity to enter waymo has their own app but they partnered with uber for the customer facing facility because uber has an established customer base and tech tesla will likely not integrate through uber but it seems like uber is the way to go for autonomous taxi providers to cut costs and focus on the tech 

what i think is happening now is people hear about tesla autonomous taxi and get scared the tech is not there yet for tesla waymo has done it with lidar and choose to partner with uber human taxis are not going anywhere all it will take is one bad accident and people will be afraid 

i see a future where autonomous taxi providers and humans compete to provide rides for customers that get to pick they all use one or two facilitators one being uber  i hope you are right and i become rich ill invite you to be party if that happens  this also its growing that fcf way faster than microsoft so pe is irrelevant with uber tbh which is why i didnt include it in my post  this is my bull thesis i think alphabet will very quickly find that its far easier and even more profitable to simply let uber handle the dtc part of the buisness  agreed google doesnt tend to favor high overhead businesses they always go asset light when they can help it  so you are pricing them them in as a glorified hertz or avis go see how those businesses are doing nothing in the autonomous future gives uber an 80b valuation uber doesnt even do those things today just as easy for waymo et al to do that than for uber to start doing that  back then when sentiments were negative meta and nflx were trading at pe of 10 and 17 thats not the case with uber now  so they know were in for a recession but youre saying _travel industry is in for a boom_ 


uber stock is the opposite of a recession hedge either buy walmart target or just get hotels hospitality stocks based on your opinion the taxi that one takes to go someplace is barely 5 of the travel budget of that 5 uber keeps 20 at best between you and the driver  like this thesis a lot i think uber is very well positioned for the future  thats certainly the case i think the recent deal was that uber provides the cleaningmaintenance for the waymo fleet and handle the customer side so waymo literally only has to worry about the ride experience and tech im bullish on uber too  i am pricing them on the fcf growth  i think you missed the other part about oil dropping off a cliff when oil prices are low the cost of travel is cheap and therefore people traveling  more business for uber  very interesting thesis you expect oil demand to plummet in the next six months due to some confluence of external factors leading to a simultaneous travel boom localized to the us  im a ta guy the chart says oils going down fairly hard but i dont know what exactly a news catalyst will be the trade off is that with low oil prices people travel more  this is also bearish for tesla and with the majority of people struggling right now and having worked to make back what covid took i think they all want a vacation especially when its cheaper",0.9669,0.9998,1
Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"i recently have started using sgov in my brokerage as a savings account which i pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts  the returns are between 4555 in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my high yield savings account hysa so i basically have discontinued using my hysa and just use sgov  i dont think i fully understand the risk after talking to a schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight  for comparison here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that i am comparing

1 sgov an etf that is 99 invested in ultra short term treasuries 30 day yield of 474  high liquidity as i can instantly buysell during market hours  share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends  interest is 99 tax free at the state level due to treasury holdings
2 mm swsbx a schwab money market account 30 day yield of 429  schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at 1 per share uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events  higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs  interest is paid directly to the account  interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings
3 hysa a high yield savings account 30 day yield of 465  bank acts as a middle man with my money investing it in treasuries and bonds and paying me a return  benefit fdic insurance  drawback slow liquidity if i need to move money around quickly  interest is subject to state and federal taxes

the schwab advisor was trying to say that sgov is not negligible risk because it is an etf so supplydemand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like sp500  he said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price  google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market so this already seems wrong  i have noticed certain days ill have a small 005 loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month  i assumed these minor losses were from buyingselling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals 1 weeks vs 4 week etc

it seems to me that there are the following risks

1 government  treasury insolvency if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as fdic insurance so im not really concerned about this
2 etf management fraud this seems like the main risk if the sgov board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99 of its resources to treasuries  the risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to sgov
3 return rate fluctuation  if federal interest rates suddenly drop it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others  therefore im not really concerned about this either  this also would only impact future returns not your principle
4 black swan event  if something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred what would happen  would sgov plummet mm be protected through schwab backing and hysa be unaffected and protected with fdic  this is my primary concern

tldr  is it possible for sgov return a negative value  i understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle",FortuneSoul,2024-11-20 04:41:27,9,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvawfq/trying_to_understand_the_mechanicsrisk_of_sgov_vs/,,"good questions i also use sgov to store my collateral for csps right now so im curious to check back for answers   always very short term risk with them if the rates suddenly go up early in the month that means the bond they bought at say 45  could be bought at say a price of 55 because of a fed hike for example then the present value of those bonds could drop over 1 suddenly they will still go up the 45  by the end of the month but you are open to a rare and short term price drop especially early in the month  risk because it is an etf so supplydemand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like sp500

etfs are structured to have creation units which allow institutions to buy or sell blocks of the funds securities to arbitrage any difference to nav  this forces the price to stay close to the nav  one sided buying or selling the etf will not drive the price of an etf like it would a stock 

etf management fraud

this is why funds have custodians and auditors  a registered fund cant do a bernie madoff and lie about its holdings because there are third parties verifying them

black swan event

treasuries are what investors would run towards in a financial crisis so sgov should do fine  the effective duration of sgov is 01 years  so if rates popped 1 percentage point overnight the nav of the fund would only drop 01  this makes sense however is there any risk from large etf outflows like the schwab rep made it sound  i thought it would be protected due to being an open ended structure and the theory that the same underlying bond interest is being distributed among the shareholders so there should be an increase in amount of interest paid to a lower number of shareholders if many people exit the etf at once since underlying is not changing  not sure i have this correct though  if it is an etf then i believe the shares are created and redeemed by authorized participants to profit and keep the share price in line with the index so there is no change in the ratio of interest payments per share

the risk differences are that a money market has an implicit guarantee not to break the buck and it very very rarely happens so if you buy a dollar you can sell for a dollar an fdic savings account you will always get your dollar back a bond etf composed of treasuries you will get the interest on the bonds but you if you want to get your dollar back you will have to find someone to sell your share to for the same price you bought it for they are all really low risk but if you look at a chart of the price of the etf it isnt a dollar bought a dollar sold  the risk is that some specific day it might go 01

and if you really need cash that one day youll suffer horribly

jokes aside the salesman has no valid argument here if you keep your cash there for more than a couple weeks the higher yield absolutely makes up for any mini volatility",0.9504,0.9869,1
"Big selling by insiders, CEO’s and big players",does anyone have any insight as to why so many big players are selling stock by the billions secform4com is showing that in the past 5 months there has been billions in selling this isnt any ordinary selling the last time something like this happened the covid dump was on the horizon it feels weird and doesnt make any sense it will make sense in hindsight but in the recent decade there hasnt been this volume of selling from what i am finding what do you suspect is going on with the markets ,Priusnhub,2024-11-19 11:06:55,220,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1guq5rh/big_selling_by_insiders_ceos_and_big_players/,,"is it different then last years around this time those orders would have had to put in before elections i believe so it could just be end year selling  tax loss harvesting or profit taking  stock wont crash much because i bought a lot of otm put leaps guaranteed nothing big happens till jan 2026

 it feels weird and doesnt make any sense

as suspected youre going off feels weird and the other historical revisionism above

as for it doesnt make sense there are actually very sensible explanations if one has a wider and better informed perspective

taking profits at the end of a massive up year isnt some secret conspiracy its normal  also billions in selling isnt large  theres billions in selling every day  also do you realize when theres billions in selling that by definition means there were counterparties doing billions in buying

its fine to consider things like metrics and sentiment but you seem to be absorbing and embellishing a vibesonly narrative  presumably because pe ratios are much higher than normal then many stocks are probably near all time highs which would lead to more selling this isnt really trying to time the market theyre just realizing some gains ive never investigated it but i wouldnt be surprised if there is a strong correlation between the pe ratio of the sp500 and the number of insider sales  new administration and mainly trump leave a lot of uncertainty for companies also the holiday effect tends to see big selling around thanksgiving and christmas as players use that money for familyrelated events vacations gifts and just purely profits  trumps win means instability  thats whats at stake  no one knows what will happen for sure but everyone is betting that his policies lead to recession which is what the rich want  recessions are mad money makers for the rich  id sell a bunch if i could now while values are high park it and let it earn some interest if trumps actions cause a crash or long decline then buy in when things are low  i do exactly the opposite of what everyone says on these subs  because they want to buy shit the mistress needs a new condo wife wants a new yacht etc  jeff bezos sold stock ahead of the election and the his washington post remained neutral on the election rather than support harris as was expected i think the data he could see through his businesses gave him better insight as to the election outcome than the polls did his actions now show you how he interprets the outcome  stocks are trading high how is it confusing it can mean a sign a top is in but not necessarily  removed  its also the season to realize gains to pay taxes in a few months especially since things are frothy  its a bot  tax loss selling  eoy loss harvesting some biiig jumps eg pltr worth at least harvesting the gains and lastly because a lot of investors like warren buffet who are very uncertain how trump policies are going to affect the market as a whole so their cashing out and holding it in reserves until after seeing what policies he actually implements how the world reacts to us investments etc until after dt is in office for a couple of weeks 

imo anyway  cashing in on all time highs in a sky high market its wise to off load some  someone has to hold the generational bag it will likely be the passive investors  i would a hundred percent be concerned about a potential bearish case of this being 2021esque now though my wrong take is actually a replay of 2018


if so involving 2021 the first warning was semiconductors from july and now the second warning may be the dow not acting the best since mid october purely due to the fact it was the leader out of the bottom in 2022 if you hate this index  end of cycle behaviour maybe probably 50 years of unrealized profit cant just exit in one go ever since fractional shares became a thing and the push for the average retailer to get involved with the stock market i always thought it was a way to get exit liquidity before a long periodic depression and we end up with a stock market like japan  tax law changes coming against the mega wealthy  timing matters  prior to election there was a lot of big selling in anticipation of a harris victory and an increase in capital gains tax including none other than warren buffet  that has subsided obviously so will look at the recent data  httpswwwsecform4com  reasons probably
1they dont want to lose money
2need cash on hand for when time comes to buy
but idk   never understood why people always ask why are insider selling when we are at all time highs in the stock market this is normal profit taking  tsla and rddt dont care  shieeeet be greedy when everyone fearful  deleted  america is a dying empire and no one but the elites wants to admit it

look at their actions  its obvious  i should think its because they are ascurd

crazy wild guess s  bro these greedy bastards just want to cash out in order to buy yachts houses and art nothing new or different in times of all time highs  trump supporters timing their sales and buys around the election trump won and they all threw their money a lot back in but it hasnt been the uphill sail that they anticipated since  these are all sold in anticipation of a harris win and a big capital gains increase for 2025

it didnt happen  im all cash right now too but i trade daily  the rate of socalled insider sales has hit a record high for any quarter in two decades according to veritydata

if a company could get screwed by tariffs or other regulatory changes it would be foolish for an exec not to at least diversify and get more of their eggs into other baskets while they have a chance

sure they could have another good year but a lot of stocks could also lose a good chunk of value as the new admin makes surprise moves  justtimeit  nostradamus over here going to time the market just right and most certainly not miss any gains lol  ahh so youre the guy that buys high and sells low  1 he sold in 2021 earlier in bidens tenure


2 hes selling more because he needs money to blow on his gf than anything else   reeeeee  tax laws under trump have always been beneficial to the rich  uh  which is what like 4 times total not a huge sample size  whats a typical amount you trade with daily  in an everexpanding economy and stock market many daysweeksmonthsyears will be new highs its just a matter of how a writer wants to twist it  likely every person here is setting a new record high for the annual salary  and they will next year  and the year after  thats mostly how it works  they know whats coming looks at tlsa insider sold 35mil worth this week stock went up not down news ignores people being locked inside a tesla and burning alive stock goes up there is alot of artificial price movement on most of the nasdaq stocks are way over valued prices spiking to historic levels and people cashing out but the people cashing out are not average joes they are insiders  show us the stats dont just say more or much more  that  i checked the charts and they seem completely unphased were going up at the same rate years before and years after then they spiked when bidens staff came in and again when trump won his second term not sure what would happen after  market ripped because he was new now we know what he is going to doit wont rip  its really not a good short term indicator but over 10 years its pretty powerful this will sound obvious but think about it how much you make on an investment depends on the price you pay there will still be some juice in this market for traders but its no longer a buy and hold investment unless you are looking at 20 years plus on a 10 year horizon you will have a better entry point and a better 10 year outcome time in the market is peddled by people that make money from you being in the market  well only if you take it as gospel and act on only that i basically buy the same every two weeks and dont try to time the market but it just seems silly to ignore that the sp 500 is up like 32 from a year ago 

the businesses are not worth a third more than a year ago it would make no sense so either it was super historically under valued a year ago or its super over valued now and every sign is pointing to over valued  the key point of my comment was if i could  i cant my bags show that i cant time crap 

im just noting why op might be seeing more insider selling after all elons claiming theyre going to crash the market right  op is talking about big players not random jimbob retail investors if you got a portfolio of 300 mill you can afford to lose out on some gainz for safety like the reality is maybe they could have a couple more mill in their portfolio but at what risk those extra couple mill dont mean shit to their life at all  nah i buy low and never sell  200k  3040k  just like everyone is touting warren buffets record cash pile as sign of incoming recession when in fact his cash allocation has been higher in the past its just highest in absolute terms because his overall portfolio is so large   yes and no when were talking about buying and selling of stocks thats a ratio so there can be also be more buyers than sellers the article references indicates that there are more insiders people in xo positions selling their stocks than insider buyers for the last 20 years  stock price goes up only bc someone is offering to pay that price  hes probably talking about this article that released today 

httpswwwftcomcontent56adeab02957481b81e49a9ac8181c6a  secform4com and search the tickersinsiders  removed  uuh no the market ripped because his policy is to cut corporate tax its only natural that would mean companies earnings will go up with his policy people are selling because the market is overvalued with an under performing economy people like buffet are hoarding cash again because there will be a correction sometime in the near future then people will say see its trump  nope it ripped because of trumps corporate tax rate cuts which translates directly into earnings revisions so the market priced those in the same they will price them in again  you better be 90 cash with advice like this or at least up to your tits in puts  

recessions typically last 2 years or less in recent history  if you can hold your investments for longer than a few years you are always better off buying now than waiting for something that may never come 

being a long term investor is the only way a regular person can build meaningful wealth trying to trade in and out will ultimately lead to failure for most there is a reason the most successful fidelity accounts are held by dead people dead people only hold and dont panic sell their entire portfolio because a single indicator told them to  one can argue that the acceleration of technology over the last decade has made at least some of these historical analysis harder to properly gauge

so many tools that look at decades of historical data to pump out the same information international stocks will recover small cap value is due for a big rebound

whatever im bullish on tech going forward and i think itll continue to prop up large cap us stocks

i may look like a fool in 10 years but maybe i wont  or the market is correctly forecasting strong earnings growth also supported by mgmt guidance from hundreds of companies  the market is always about to crash according to someone  you were specifically asked to point to a source and link and not to stir up and promote the entire website  also i noticed how you conveniently deleted a comment

even when you back out covid spending the national deficit increased substantially under trump


again you say you care about spending 


also theres no contemplated pandemic spending in his next terms proposals so explain why the deficit is projected to increase substantially  wow the level of economic and correlation vs causation incompetence in this post is staggering  lol you care about spending and inflation now

lol have you actually looked at how much the deficit increased under trump

have you looked into how much the deficit will increase under his new proposals  bro i hate to break it to you but inflation is caused by too many dollars chasing two few goods and maybe we should take a guess at which president printed 50 of all dollars ever created prior to his administration any guesses

do you understand what inflation is 

do you understand how the money supply affects inflation 

has nothing to do with a republican or a democrat  biden had to bring down inflation caused by trumps horrendous covid response and unchecked spending and he was successful inflation has come down

if you want to pretend to care about spending where is your criticism of trump he spends more than biden despite inheriting 2 great economies in his terms  i mean the trumpo administration has admitted theyre going to tank the economy he also has policy to bassically piss off all of the us trade partners so i mean theyre probably preparing for that not that stocks are not overvalued but theyre dam mear planning to just death spiral the economy  yeah but once all the immigrants are gone white people still wont work so earnings fuuuuuucked  ok so which time were they wrong a year ago when it was a third lower or now they cant both have been correct  yup  hes trying to pull a do your own research while also making the claim  yeah  explain how please which point specifically am i getting wrong here

there are a million democrat shills here on reddit that will say anything to defend the party no matter how bad it gets and its bad right now  so say something that isnt just a shallow empty statement that proves me wrong or that you arent just a dem shill  dont be a democratic shill 
s  facts dont care about my feelings  i do understand what inflation is and there was no elevated inflation under the trump administration  since you bring the printing up  he had no choice because of a pandemic that closed the country down im pretty sure you know this and your argument is deceptive and misleading but for the sake of argument he had no choice biden however gave out stimulus checks after everything was open and the economy was recovering  totally unacceptable i knew it even then and im not the only one  

you are definitely viewing this through a keyhole and missing the big picture  biden continued to spend even after the fed had to increase interest rates to tame the inflation in effect fighting against what the fed was doing  so yes i know what inflation is and trump definitely contributed to it but he had little choice biden however did have a choice and continued spending anyway despite warnings from the fed jaimie diamond and a shitton of other really really smart people who saw this getting out of control  show me proof of where they said were going to tank the economy tell me some actual policies  the comment of a child  youre correct i think it was wrong in 2022 obviously and correct this time but we shall see  dude was talking what he saw in the charts a thought out response  would include data that confirms denies or provides context you went into a political rant and asked them to check again not sure what youre trying to do in a stocks subreddit  smell shoe shine on your own time  you talk about biden spending and spending yet trump added 6 trillion to the us debt in his presidency thats 2 trillion more than biden the spending of 2020 was the biggest factor in the inflation of the biden administration  look at the m2 money supply bidens administration had to get it under control after trump flooded the market with liquidity  lol doing nothing but calling me a name  rather than disproving me 

edit oh my bad missed the sarcasm  a simple no i dont understand would have worked better  i think hes referring to the blanket tarriff policies increased costs for imports  passed along to the consumer  less purchasing power  slowdown  congratulations you voted for a person whose policies tarrifs you dont even understand which we knew most of you didnt 

you didnt read the words coming directly from his head of the newly formed doge donald trumps close ally and major economic adviser elon musk is warning supporters to expect economic chaos a crashing stock market and financial hardship  albeit temporary  if trump wins

you dont understand basic economic concepts such as supply and demand and how when the world opened pretty abruptly in 2021 demand was significantly higher than supply which allowed sellers of goods to charge whatever they wanted you dont educate yourself to the fact that countries across the world had way worse inflation than us

why would we point out anything to you when you havent been paying attention in the first place and wed have to give you a government and economics lesson to boot  its been said more than once musk even said things would get worse before they got better meanwhile they will loot and sell off our great grandparents investments in society to their buddies for pennies on the dollar its gonna be rough how are we seeing completely different narratives  i paraphrased the word tank but its not far off from what he himself has agreed with httpswwwfastcompanycom91220386sometemporaryhardshipelonmuskadmitsplanwithtrumpharmeconomy  tank the economy by lowering government spending by 2 trillion dollars seems like an esoteric approach  dont even bother dude 90 of reddit needs to wash their brains  his plan to just tarrif everything will definetly annoy all of our trade partners  a smart child  they did it in alabama or arkansas you know one of the family fucker states i cant remember which in the 2010s  it didnt go well at all the child is right if you look at history  thats someone else and they said s for sarcasm  i dont think you understand thats the problem  ill go one better i dont think you would admit to it even if it was crystal clear according to you the fed and the ceo of the biggest bank in the world dont know inflation is either or what caused it because they both said exactly what im saying now 

its not your fault people with tds cant help but blame him for everything even when its obvious it not there is no known cure  id actually say its more likely its referring to elon and viveks program and elon saying we need to crash it hard to build something better and more sustainable out of it

theres a huge problem though here they may say they want to cut 2 trillion in spending but realistically if they want to try it just through executive and not congress who is unlikely to agree theyre going to have lawsuits filed on them and i think this is too far for the supreme court  yea thats a fair argument but its not even that bad government employees are going to get 2 years severance pay if those people land another job theyd be doing great 

the us government runs a huge deficit currently paying 12 trillion in annual interest you either cut government spending or you keep getting inflation  i gotta say im surprised theres this many idiots in stocks they should be in stonks buying gme  you mean china he already did that in his first presidency if it was so bad why didnt biden remove any of it instead they added more  not judging by that remark  oops good catch thanks  critical thinking is the ability to draw your own conclusions from facts sounds like you get your conclusions drawn for you be some leftist big bank ceo 

what makes you think he had no choice cmon now are you for real he was the god damn president and there is always a choice an actual conservative which it sounds like you know nothing about would never spent 8 trillion dollars of deficit spending on handouts 

your arguments fall right in line with mainstream media talking points  or you raise taxes instead of cutting them for corporations and the top earners cutting spending isnt the only answer  because china added retalitory tarrifs the us cant just lift its tarrifs when china came back and had their own not just china mate pretty sure trump is on quote saying 20 tarrif on everything  the tax cuts from 2017 expire in december of 2025 no  thats what biden did  chinas tarrifs doesnt hurt the us much the us imports much more products from china than it exports this is not a left or right policy its across party lines and will be going forward as the us decouples from china manufacturing is already headed to other parts of asia any old factories from an old japanese or korean manufacturer is going to get dumped and rebuilt im a different country the western alliance needs to keep china from rising to the top

his 20 tarrif grand scheme is to remove income tax and just use tarrifs  which is not going to happen he wants to bring back manufacturing to the us to please his base i believe there is some plan to have little to no tax for american made products",-0.4939,0.9992,-1
DoJ wants to Breakup Google,"bloomberg reported in the after hours that doj wants to push google to sell chrome
chrome due to search monopoly the doj wants to ask the judge mehta to force google what do we think about it


httpsnewsbloomberglawcomuslawweekdojwillpushgoogletoselloffchrometobreaksearchmonopoly",Such-Ice1325,2024-11-19 04:19:28,772,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gui0ub/doj_wants_to_breakup_google/,,"judges name just happens to be mehta  must not matter google barely went down in aftermarket  the antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced google to sell off android

what the hell have i just read  haha sell chrome

what is this 1993 and theyre doing the microsoft antitrust lawsuit   so basically nothing happens sell chrome and the new company uses google default anyway  if chrome makes money its by directed people to google search and youtube and gmail and drive and google play etc where google can data collect and sell stuff not really an appealing business to have a web browser product without the search engine bussing to default users to just tank chromium development funding and give a new avenue for firefox to make a strong comeback  just selling chrome browser is not bad at all

honestly not even a scratch  first of all doubt it will happen

second why now rather than 15 years ago

third is chrome  arguably their least integrated product  even enough to make a dent in anything let alone call it a breakup

fourth remember the microsoft case  isnt chromium open source they could then just launch google chromium which is the exact same thing  isnt the new administration coming in a few months i am not saying trump wont continue down the same path but shouldnt the current administration just leave these important decisions to their successor is it just a symbolic move so that they can claim its my legacy

that aside i dont understand the decision of selling chrome a browser by itself is hardly a viable business just look at mozilla wouldnt it make more sense to break out android and play folks at doj probably dont really know how to operate a business  good time to buy goog right now they will be 3t market cap in the next couple of years this case is simply noise us gov wont ever forcibly breakup a us based mega cap tech company too much lobbying helps china and a breakup ultimately doesnt make money go look at goog finances company is unbelievable up in almost every sector they have an army of lawyers will appeal for years worst come worst one of the proposals was making users select their choice of internet browsers when they first buy a device then they just select google lmfao what a joke  sell to whom any potential parties interested in buying  lol chrome of all things if they wanted to go for the jugular they couldve gone for youtube or even cloud nothing will happen  lol hey you are too good you must sell

i thought this was america  all that for a drop of blood  my 190 december calls are cooked  doj have certainly proved their wisdom in these matters in their recent virtual execution of spirit and likely dooming of the budget domestic flight market  this is one of those reddit threads where you realize how dumb reddit is as a whole

you dont know how chrome works as a business model clearly you dont recognize the significance of it 

the markets reacted this way because if they are going for chrome they have no chance at meeting the anti trust requirements to make it happen  this is standard background noise

it doesnt hurt the company or stock

buy


next 47 comes into office the doj will drop any case like this  for fucks sake every week its something with google cant catch a break  this wont happen and the doj is out sooo lets just move along here  honestly that might be good for google split off their newer cutting edge future tech from the old boring low revenue stuff personally id love to get shares of waymo assuming musk doesnt kill it  yawn the department of injustice will lose  if they really wanted to break up google theyd separate porn searches and whatever the other people search for  sundar pichai 100 million donation to trump incoming  doj did shit against trump and musk alike because they are too powerful so they just bully google instead  even if it happens it will take years and there will be no material impact on alphabet other than legal fees if it does eventually happen the sum of the parts might actually benefit investors

that said there will be a new boss at the doj soon and they very well might kill this  from all the magnificent 7 google is the only one that developed really useful practical products that made life easier for people think about google maps google translate besides of course their search engine this only helps the other bigtech monopoly companies microsoft apple amazon meta to destroy a rival  i hate this i love chrome it integrates well with all the google services i use plus chrome would never exist if google did not fund it and make it into a market leader through merit against stacked odds btw 

remember microsoft had the browser market on lock and still to this day tries to sneakily make it the default every chance it gets having built it using google chromes open source code no less all the cases against google are bs and should be dropped this is a prime example of big government marxists whove never run a lemonade stand attacking anything successful enough  whole new administration coming all bets are off at doj run by a pedo gaetz  chrome chrome noooo  biden antagonizing big tech proved to be pretty stupid going into an election cycle too powerful trump will probably cut a deal with google to squash this  there goes my goog shares  the likelihood that this results in a forced divestiture of chrome is very low for a lot of reasons for starters they do not have the only search engine bing may suck but it is owned by microsoft which is in fact a bigger company than google by market cap  so they could definitely compete if it mattered to them  duckduckgo also produces the same thing the competition which duckduckgo offered with their lack of tracking even demonstrates differentiation exists in the market

moreover google adwords their search product can be manually created on websites by selling ad space to sponsors  placing an ad without the network of googles platform outbrain does similar spots

technically speaking more broadly search ads are just digital marketing which also exists on social media or email sms streaming etc are all alternatives to google

hell television  radio can also be places businesses spend money on promotions

also sem google search result ad locations are not inherently valuable for other businesses whereas they are more beneficial for certain industries like legal firms

microsoft pioneered this whole fake monopoly act in the 90s all it does is signals to the market that the stock is worth more than it is today ads speculation which drives the options markets and ultimately gives the big business a chance to write or rewrite the laws  all i see are call or put holders shilling their positions in this post   chrome is the baby of pichai he would never sell it lol  seems a lot better for google than it could be  im buying more stock tomorrow  whats next  they will ask microsoft to sell windows  meta to selll whatsapp  amazon next  buying if it hits 160 againagain  it says chrome chrome  plot twist  it will never break down  i read this as buy opra stock

stock is below intrinsic value and with all that noise it is gonna skyrocket  microsoft could totally ass fuck google in its most vulnerable stage by discontinuing bing and making it black and white that google has dominance in search engine market  of all the things splitting off chrome is not going to make a difference at all  what will happen to chromebooks i love mine and hope google will keep making them  i dont understand was microsoft forced to sell internet explorer did they ask apple to sell safari  the latest from trump was that google shouldnt be broken up that technologies like that is a bulwark against china


but he wants the algorithm changed as he claims it was negative towards him


is that not factored in   what a coincidence just yesterday i said thats never gonna happen  good they never should have been able to buy youtube and ruin it  trump is reinforcing the isolationism into economy google is a monopoly and they are obedient compared to many others should or would they force them to break up significantly i doubt it  the end where it is suggested openai could purchase chrome is such a joke seems ironic considering the reason for the push to break up googl  maybe this wood have happened in a kamala presidency  in a trump one  lol  a bit dumb imo why should a company give something they worked hard for away why dont they ask for instagram and amazon as well  something tells me they wont be lol  makes sense anytime i googled anything about the election it was just borderline defamation of djt they should be broken up indeed  i think both google and meta should be broken up  okay what about all the other monopolies


nooooooooooo conservative judge  filthy spying controlling mofos

im referring to google not doj

google has broken every single copyright and privacy law since its inception but because anybody who stood up to them got delisted from their search which would leave their business dead in the water so everyone had to put up with the illegal nature of their business model

a quote from one of the founders just moments before launch we are going to make a lot of money or we are going to spend a long time in jail  if this goes anything like how microsoft went then it isnt going to happen  now lets be honest is this a surprise it is the definition of a natural monopoly at least in my opinion  forced to sell to whom elonia  what is chrome chrome os and chromebook or chrome browser it should be youtube if any  i dont use google so theres no monopoly  who wouldve thought rstocks is filled with people who have no understanding of the foundations of antitrust law and capitalism oh wait everyone  who gives a fuck theyll obviously appeal  it would be massive if they were to sell youtube and break the creator economy  which doj just stall till matt gaetz gets in and send over some girls problem solved  google probably wont have to do anything iphones have safari default that alone can show they dont own the browser space and people have choice for search engine also chrome allows other search engines for default  its not a monopoly though  with all the nonsense going around the next thing we here will be that trump is going to order meta and google to accept elon musk as their lord and savior  i own a lot of googgoogl and id actually love to see them broken up and get shares of all of the parts 

but just selling off chrome seems pointless its just a browser and doesnt work any better with the rest of googles services than firefox or safari or edge do 

the only real unfair advantage they get from owning chrome is that they dont have to pay themselves to be the default search provider iirc they pay firefox a ton of money to use google search by default and they pay apple even more by orders of magnitude if chrome is split off they would pay chromes new company a ton of money to use google search by default  would be excellent if the stock falls tomorrow on this news would gladly accumulate  this is so stupid microsoft has the most dominate os system windows which has edge as the default browser which has bing as the default search engine they have the full stack yet edge and bing are not dominate and there is a reason they are the inferior products ive been using bing for the last two weeks because of their million dollar giveaway and its absolutely garbage

also google open sourced chromium that other browser are built off of and can be built off of so its not like they have some monopoly on browser technology  and add term limits while youre at it  could definitely shake up googles dominance if it happens  thats stupid make them sell android or play store  deleted  makes absolute sense chrome and youtube are monopolies monopolies are really really bad for consumers and we saw what kind of deranged power they accumulate when left unchecked  its zuck in a mustache and wig  lmfao michael shoft is also on the case  lol poetic  apparently judge chadra jipiti had a conflict of interest and was dismissed  indian zuckerberg  very common indian name  fyi  mehta is pronounced as meh  tha 

ie h in meh is not silent and the ta at the end is smooth like in thank and not like in target  that should honestly be the name of meta  zuck snuck the h in hoping we wouldnt notice  sus  this has been looming all year if anything it will go up since its just chrome  priced in  trump will reduce the trust busting so its not a big deal  trump admin is gonna make all the tech antitrust go away  this is all they are talking about doing the stock will go up  happy cake day cake day buddy  it doesnt matter because the current administration is incompetent and ineffective   yeah i dont even understand what selling chrome even means i can see stop developing or distributing it externally but while the chromium open source project exists who would buy chrome itself  lmao so sell chrome was actually their compromise position these antitrust folks are wild  trivia chrome was the first google product whose external name was the same as its internal name and android was the second  these judges are pathetic they cant do any of that  google would appeal and they would be dead by the trial  i mean it makes sense because a dedicate chrome business would work well considering how many people want to pay for web browsers s

give it to mozilla  they should make ms sell edge as well shouldnt they  we are forced to use chrome at work  and teams    so it double sucks  exactly they are so pathetic  pretty sure they will also try to stop google from being able to buy default status from anyone  firefox itself is struggling with funding so far i have yet seen a viable profitable standalone browser company at scale  chrome is maybe the single biggest intangible asset that google has if google is forced to sell it would be bad for their investors with chrome they have the biggest voice on what will go into web standards and apis which allows google to push the future of the internet in their interests that and they use it to promote their search and their other websites for nothing plus they can do things like get rid of ad blocking for what is by far the largest browser if they want and chromium is actually almost all other browsers under the hood too its worth a lot less if sold than it is to google because another owner or independent company wouldnt be able to monetize it in the same way dont get me wrong they could squeeze a few bucks out of it but it wouldnt be worth the price multiple at sale for the degradation of googles competitive advantage  how does chrome even make money  if chrome made yahoo the default engine google would probably be in trouble no  this   why now rather than 15 years ago

chrome and android were a year old at the time and youtube wasnt much older  exactly my thoughts

who gives af ab chrome

and this smells a whole lot like the msft antitrust case where it was largely redundant  microsoft then ms will deprecate edge and replace it with chrome and default the search engine to bing  the goal isnt to go for the jugular they arent trying to crush one of the largest tech companies in the world   why the fuck would they go for the jugular thats not the point of this case at all are you loaded with alphabet puts lol  chrome is huge chrome recently stopped supporting ublock origin so google can force more ads down our throats  theyre trying to break up a monopoly not a conglomerate its not illegal to be a conglomerate owning youtube isnt preventing competition in search owning the most popular web browser and having that browser set your search engine as the default option does prevent competition in search  why would the us government go for the jugular of a big us company every other democratic country in the world protects its domestic mega corporations  youtube could not survive on its own and neither could android  seems personal sundar climbed the ranks from chrome  this is america  antitrust laws are extraordinarily important for a number of reasons but perhaps most important to ensure competition which leads to innovation and consumer protection  whether or not these laws are correctly implemented in any given case is a different story  yes and no

capitalism absolutely needs competition to be healthy since monopolies hurt consumers

the problem in googles case is that they have had plenty of competition over the years google beat them fair and square

in a lot of ways you are right google shouldnt be punished for that

dojs time is better spent preventing companies from buying out their fledgling competitors

disclaimer google shareholder  the america before standard oil  att  the problem is theyre too big not too good if they were good people wouldnt be pissed at google to make them sell shit  as a foreigner its so sad to see the degradation of freedom values  to make things worse chrome is pretty bad its just the least bad  i wouldnt be so confident about that the new administrations fcc chair is also antibig tech

mr carr 45 was the author of a chapter on the fcc in the conservative project 2025 planning document in which he argued that the agency should also regulate the largest tech companies such as apple meta google and microsoft
the censorship cartel must be dismantled mr carr said last week in a post on x  and if on the smaller chance 47 wants to go after goog it will be a whole more than just chrome  and mehta will be the first target  i doubt google would sell chrome to a direct competitor like openai or microsoft  i agree but if i have to pick only one then it is google for sure i dont think the doj has enough resources to fight 2 tech giants at the same time also its not easy to argue that meta has a monopoly on anything on the other hand that is rather easy to do with google  according to the article is just the browser  chrome is maybe the single biggest intangible asset that google has if google is forced to sell it would be bad for their investors with chrome they have the biggest voice on what will go into web standards and apis which allows google to push the future of the internet in their interests that and they use it to promote their search and their other websites for nothing plus they can do things like get rid of ad blocking for what is by far the largest browser if they want and chromium is actually almost all other browsers under the hood too its worth a lot less if sold than it is to google because another owner or independent company wouldnt be able to monetize it in the same way dont get me wrong they could squeeze a few bucks out of it but it wouldnt be worth the price multiple at sale for the degradation of googles competitive advantage  soon to be transitioned into the doge  donald trump  embrace the zuck  and also tim apfel  hey if armand hammer can be on arm  hammers board of directors then why not

armand hammer is a real person who only got involved with arm  hammer because people kept asking him about it due to his name  took me a minute lol   the sound is actually between th and t it doesnt exist in english  wrong its pronounced meh  ta ta is like in pasta  and not like in thanks   its more like maytha  meh  and thats the main takeaway from the article  i dont think its just chrome from nyt either sell android its smartphone operating system or bar google from making its services mandatory on phones that use android to operate if google broke those terms or the remedies failed to improve competition the government could force the company to sell android at a later date in a sweeping filing the government also asked the judge to stop google from entering into paid agreements with apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on smartphones and in browsers google should also be required by the court to allow rival search engines to display the companys results and access its data for a decade the government said  

the part about apple is ridiculous and a major over reach in my opinion apple should be allowed to sell exclusivity it should go to the highest bidder if another browser cant afford to bid get some pe backing if the roi is so promising 

i dont even get the last part about rival search engines displaying google search results for a decade that would mean they get to use google algorithms for a decade

all of this i understandwe are in uncharted waters for companies this big but there is a massive ecosystem of shareholders and partner companies that could be decimated by this me being onemy ability to retire is heavily reliant on google stock value in the future so who is really getting punished here and who is really benefiting  trump also said he disliked how google favored the democratic party previously so they might not be safe  i say this with google being my largest single holding and a complete belief theyre criminally undervalued based on fundamentals and future innovation  but im not optimistic this will all just go away with a new administration  this trial started under previous trump administration  why would he bigtech was vocally liberal payback time  this is interesting there is a decent chance trump will actually do this the antitrust is priced in already so any positives on this for google would be good for the stock price  i thought maga hated big tech  some google exec with a fake mustache claiming to be mr juan carlos from chrome lowriders  its relevant the chrome you have is different software from the open source chromium each keystroke page visit carefully anonymized mapped to certain target themes and topics to show you relevant ads across yt maps search 


try it use both browsers on your device as unregistered user in chrome look for pet shops pet care and watch what ads you see across google in chromium try a different topic eg buy car you will likely wont see car ads as much  these antitrust folks are years late this isnt wild at all  i dont get the significance  mozilla pretty much only exists because google pays them to be the default search providersooooooooooo  only possible way is to also ban others then in that case google still wins as they now just dont have to pay  the eu already has regulation which prohibit those default statuses
  httpswwwandroidpolicecomtheeunewdefaultbrowserruleswork  they could just go back to working with mozilla to creating new standards google only created chrome so they could dictate web tech without input from anyone else the world would be better if chrome just died at this point   that and they use it to promote their search

yeah if chrome didnt default to google search i would def use bing instead  which allows google to push the future of the internet in their interests

  
cant quite tell if youre for or against the breakup lol something seems eerily anti competitive about a company being able to push the future of the internet in their interests

 dont get me wrong they could squeeze a few bucks out of it but it wouldnt be worth the price multiple at sale for the degradation of googles competitive advantage

so youre basically saying that if this was the same product by anyone else it wouldnt be worth as much that sounds like a bubble to me frankly  theyd just make another chrome  google sells ads not web domination 

the eu has been forcing people to choose search engine for a decade and the percentage of google search is even higher  in eu than rest of world  you basically described why they should be made to sell it 


cornering the market isnt good for anyone but them  chrome is native to android and is necessary for them to prevent losing markets hare in search on mobile losing chrome will fundamentally restructure googles business  it sets google as the default browser  ironically google gave me this result

advertising

 google chrome automatically sets google as the default search engine which leads to more ads being served to users google also sells ad space on other google products like maps and youtube and on partner sites and apps 

using related google services

 users who use chrome are more likely to use other google services like gmail google docs and google apps these services are highly integrated so each time a product is used page views increase and ad revenue increases 

tracking user data

 chrome tracks user data to improve googles adsense program advertisers bid to show in ad spaces in a realtime auction and the highest paying ads appear on the site  plugin store  i would be in trouble because yahoo fucking sucks as a search engine  i miss 2006 era youtube  youtube was founded 2005 and acquired 2006 though it would not report income separately until recently by 2009 it was clearly a monopoly by itself  edge is already chromium based  firefox endorses googles management decisions  ublock lite works fine though  is it googles fault that people choose to use chrome willingly then the default browser on windows is edge and the default browser on apple is safari no ones forcing people to download chrome why is it monopolistic if google pushes their own search product on chrome isnt that intuitive and natural for any company how about apple having their own appstore on all iphones and devices or windows having bing as its default search on edge

this is just like saying windows computers and laptops having the search engine set to bing as default is anticompetitive and hence should be stopped as well even though in actuality no one uses bing cause its bad seriously ridiculous because this move by doj just seems resultsoriented more than anything because of the fact that majority of people willingly choose to use googles browser it sets a dangerous precedent if doj wins  you can set the browser as whatever you want 

you can set the search engine as whatever you want  how is that google fault  blame the competitors for sucking  chrome is a shit product i rather use ff because it has better option to block google ads  but i will still use google over duck or bing for search

consumers love monopoly because a monopoly means the company is the top competitor and the default winner look at steam  whats the point in using other inferior launcher  same with ms os  why learn niche os while enterprise systems will continue to use win xp instead  neither can chrome  actually it was android  they had competition which was where they shined but now that the competiton is gone  speaking of telecoms companies i think were well overdue talking a look at cable

that is a literal monopoly as most cant choose an alternative  thats different hes just mad that you cant drop the nbomb on facebook and i dont think forcing meta to sell off facebook is how theyd go about changing that  deleted  id agree but trump and proj 2025 are not related from a sense that its his work or that he commissioned it  anti big tech because of censorship and anti business are two different things  as is the incoming vice president  they is odd does not make sense if android makes more sense  a zuck a day keeps the mankind away  also nate felix  i dont get it  he also mentioned that he doesnt want china to beat us and would be careful of breaking it up  he is obsessed with the market and will be weary to do anything that would shake it up  china hes made it very clear he wants to fight chinas rise with anything possible main reasons hes going back to fossil fuels tariffs low regulations  thats why they have been slowly warming up to trump bezos blocked the wapo endorsement of harris zuck talked about how heroic trump looked after the failed assassination not to mention the millions in donations to each party to hedge bets  big tech is here to stay otherwise the us will end up being 3 decades behind china in ai tech  does ublock with anti tracking protect you or is this kind of tracking too much baked into chrome  idk i think the way the eu has done it is better its obviously not fair if the worlds search engine also has a browser that defaults to use their search engine but if the company is building a great product you also dont want to take that from the user to solve just dont allow the browser to automatically set the default search and have it ask the user i think thats the best outcome for consumers  this  i think youre hinting that if google doesnt have chrome this means more cash for mozilla

its amazing how much money the execs at mozilla have just pocketed with literally no innovation its a complete scam  this banning companies from buying the default search will only help google in my opinion  which if you look at search engine market share it had zero impact on google because no other search engine can be the default  i dont even really like chrome but killing chrome would be terrible for the web at this point then who is left just firefox and safari  you wouldnt but millions potentially nearly billions of people do just use the default  it is called vertical integration a bubble is something else entirely  i think google having this much control over the internet is a bad thing for the internet i bought google shares and a few other companies because i dont want to be a serf i agree with the doj that this breakup sounds like a good thing for the internet but a bad thing for my google position

its not a bubble its worth more to google because of the intangible value to google if it was an independent company it would have nothing to gain by pushing google search or google drive onto you and their power to decide what will go into web apis would have a lot less value  thats correct  but search tab is more important  like i use safari on phone but my search tab is google  same thing with ff on pc google search  i dont use chrome because it has less extensions than ff  

chrome can die off and nothing of value will be lost if google search bar is the default  i think google should dump it off to ms for 100200b to trick them in buying chrome  everyone will set their search bar to google either way  even apple knows this and the default browser is safari that everyone uses due to default privacy and ads block  you reveal an important point yahoo used to rule the search engine market whos to say google search will be able to retain dominance in search for the next four years even if the trump cabal leaves it alone  i sure as hell dont miss the era of dialup speeds and 360p videos  because they make 90 of their money fromgoogle  thats a gimped version  why do you think fault is a factor here monopolies hinder competition and competition leads to innovation

what would really fix the sector is the doj stopping the rampant and complete pilfering of user data  why do you think fault or blame are factors here they are not

educated consumers do not love monopolies monopolies stifle innovation and make it near impossible for any other entity to compete which is bad for innovation bad for the economy bad for anyone who wants to start a business the problem is that it is extremely difficult for a consumer to be fully educated on every product they use in their lives 

the idea of breaking up monopolies is that if the product is so good it should be able to compete fairly without the benefits of a monopoly its pretty depressing that this needs to be explained  streaming has basically killed cable once all the boomers are gone cable will not exist anymore  the problem is that the current bs are all former bells lol like they broke them up slowly got bought up and now its att they got bought by cingular vs verizon the only bells that made it were cincinnati bell and frontier which is pending a sale to verizon lol  cable will be dead in a decade no oversight is needed  youtube tv  lmao  hes close with many that worked on p2025  youre right android or youtube would make a lot more sense imo  ma im out of rozucks  cant forget about en vida  chat gpt   i mean im not selling anytime soon  might even add more  browser search video media fsd  10 top line growth crazy fcf  theres no better investment out there from an alpha perspective imo  same thing happens with 60 tariffs on ai hardware everything trump says conflicts so that everyone gets to hear what they want to hear  i should experiment with that no idea tbh 


but cookies aside therere so many ways to track a user or the household ip address and browsing history would be the easiest then so many people have the habit of staying logged in to their google account its so easy to chase you across devices  except google optimize its sites for better experience in chrome 

and every fucking time i go to a google site with edge i have to click a pop up saying that i dont want to change to chrome and edge is a chromium browser itself  no because unless theyve moved on from it several governments have been going after them for paying to be the default search engine too 

i know nothing of the financials of mozilla but they make a free product and arent google apple or microsoft so idk what you expect   yeah i mean already happening in eu you had to choose the default search engine from a random list and guess what people select google because chances are 90 of the population dont even recognize anything other than google  bing  yeah basically nobody wants to develop a browser must be a lot of work  you mean blink webkit and gecko right  well they could just create a new fork of chromium and call it google browser  i truly am the only one that likes edge arent i  edge baby  arc  i literally cant find what im looking for on bing i dont know how it can be this bad after its existed for so long  im pretty sure default is google on safari although i dont own an iphone although doesnt google pay apple hundreds of millions for that 

also if the default search bar were not google i think a lot of older people would just leave it and google would lose a lot of money    i think google should dump it off to ms for 100200b to trick them in buying chrome

selling chrome to microsoft doesnt seem like a good way to reduce monopolies though  google is a verb these days theres no way its losing relevance anytime soon its a giant  that what i said when google had their ipo in 2004 apart from the bit about trump

i was very very wrong  having dial up in 2006 must have sucked  what im arguing is that theres nothing inherently anticompetitive about google pushing their own search on chrome because chrome in the first place isnt forced on consumers in any way dojs solution of going for chrome just seems to be an artificial way to hinder the company rather it being a legitimate response to any fundamentally anticompetitive practice

its a slippery slope if the doj can break up companies at any whim why would anyone even innovate anymore  except almost every single company that was broken up and turned into smaller companies still maintained their monopoly so idk what benefit you speak of or need i remind you how slow the rollout of fiber wasis bc of a certain telecom duopoly that used to be the same monopoly

where exactly were the innovations and customers friendliness there  ari cal is there  i use edge at work and have not encountered that error 
it doesnt show up when i search with google either  its only free because google pays for it  a lot of work and basically no profits web browsers are just software utilities at this point thats why every major browser has to be subsidized instead of generating direct revenue unless people want to see browsers with embedded ads instead of ad blockers  webkit really needs to just die urgh horrible to work with and so many problems its literally like dealing with ie6 again at times

we got so many issues with our website that were exclusive to iossafari especially around text clippingfonts due to webkit shenanigans  lol that would be kind of funny if that worked  edge is based on chrome if chrome died then edge probably would too  edge is based on chromium they probably eventually go down if chrome does  arc is based on chromium if chrome dies then all of the chromium browsers lose their main developer

also i just looked arc is apparently being abandoned lol so probably not a good option regardless  20 billion to be exact  oh im not saying its going away but it wont stay the absolute dominant search engine forever we are already seeing chatgpt functions as a search engine what amazing new tool is still in the lab that we dont know about  compared to todays speed  price value the sht offered back in 2006 might as well be dial up  if the doj can break up companies at any whim

they cant google had the opportunity to defend themselves in courtthe judge ruled it was a monopoly in august i suggest you read their opinion herehttpsstatic01nytcomnewsgraphicsdocumenttoolsf6ab5c368725101c43d7c2a0fullpdf  i heard judge tui terr wanted to break up musks x  or the fact that its opensource  thats a lot of my point if google stops paying mozilla or anyone for that matter there might not be a mozilla chromium is open source too and has major backing i dont see much support for firefox and as a user this bums me out chrome is the new ie a lot of sites have just stopped checking their sites in firefox  its open source its free because no one owns the code   how is facebook staying the dominant social network forever  nah i had already been playing mmos like wow for years by then it wasnt a sore spot because it was all we knew and it was way better than the true dial up years  judge blu skye was my dominatrix as her side hustle",0.0,0.9979,0
Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"embattled server maker super micro computer said on monday that its hired bdo as its new auditor and submitted a plan to nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange the shares jumped 23 in extended trading

this is an important next step to bring our financial statements current an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency super micro ceo charles liang said in a statement

super micro is late in filing its 2024 yearend report with the sec and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor ernst  young stepped down in october ernst  young was new to the job having just replaced deloitte  touche as super micros accounting firm in march 2023

super micro said it told nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended june 30 and quarterly report for the period ended sept 30 the company said it will remain listed on the nasdaq pending the exchanges review of the compliance plan

shares of super micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in march of this year but the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with nasdaq once valued at about 70 billion the companys market cap was at 126 billion at the close on monday following a 16 rally during regular trading

super micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom due to its relationship with nvidia sales last fiscal year more than doubled to 15 billion

on monday super micro announced that it was selling products featuring nvidias nextgeneration ai chip called blackwell the company competes with vendors like dell and hewlett packard enterprise in packaging up nvidia ai chips for other companies to access

super micro was added to the sp 500 in march reflecting its rapidly growing business and thensoaring stock price less than two weeks after the index changes were announced super micro reached its closing high of 11881

the troubles began within months in august super micro said it wouldnt file its annual report with the sec on time noted short seller hindenburg research then disclosed a short position in the company and said in a report that it identified fresh evidence of accounting manipulation the wall street journal later reported that the department of justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company

the month after announcing its report delay super micro said it had received a notification from the nasdaq indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasnt in compliance with the exchanges listing rules super micro said the nasdaqs rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance based on that timeframe the deadline was monday

ill be honest ever since sp500 added tsla so quickly it made me cautious about how the sp500 operates it feels like its to lax  why did ey bail  apparently they lost an xai contract about this which was given to dell i imagine next 12 ers will be ugly due to lost contracts  i wish that i could have solved my problems by doing a whitecollar crime and after being caught get away by replacing my accountant but something tells me that the judge will be less convinced in my case  hey reddit smci bulls this has happened before
httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20241105supermicrofacesdelistingsp500removalamidauditorwoes

 it wouldnt be the first time that super micro has been delisted the company was delisted in 2019 after failing to meet deadlines to file a 10k and several quarterly reports it got approval to rejoin in 2020 the same year super micro resolved an investigation by the us securities and exchange commission into its accounting by paying a 175 million penalty super micro didnt admit to or deny the regulators allegations as part of its settlement  they even missed the deadline to appeal the delisting from nasdaq ffs 


theyve known since september about the delisting the paperwork was due on the 16th and they still missed it by two days 


incompetent or crooks i dont care   whats the fastest a company got delisted from the sp500 after joining it  o wish i would have bought calls when i said i was friday  here comes account firm number three in two years  good luck  hope they got delisted  gonna pick same shares at 1 then  fuck this company  from deloitte to ey to bdo still sound quite risky until annual report is filed imo  who hired the first set of auditors are they still employed

yes they hired the second set  notice a problem  company is still a dumpster fire wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole  and so it begins  soooooo all and all what are we doing  hahahha  fuck yeah  and to think i only sold my calls for 120 profit today   no numbers released yet 

theyll be fake  if the deadline was yesterday and they didnt submit a plan they must get delisted end of story  bought 100 shares at 2280 after everybody on reddit started shifting on them and said to avoid at all cost sold a cc with 31 strike yesterday when i saw the massive iv spike im fine with getting called away and if not i keep selling ccs  smci is a chinese scam company  shares bouncing back shows potential for recovery lets see if they can get back on track  nice my leaps will print tomorrow they are already 220 up  this is just kicking the can down the road  two previous auditors resigned  no reason to think the company management has changed their approach to correct accounting practices  probably more bad news ahead  enjoy the pop while it lasts  theyre not changing the books theyre changing auditors

though it is a massive fucking redflag that one of the big 4 resigned from the engagement prior to issuing an opinion or refusing to likely to manage firmlevel risk related to catastrophic legal liability to ey and none of the other 3 firms took up the engagement looks like bdo is the next man up 

usually this only happens if there is serious concern around a word that rhymes with dog

kind of shocked they popped on hiring a new nonbig 4 auditors so that they can stay listed on nasdaq

edit holy fuck just looked through a few of their filings around thishttpswwwsecgovixdocarchivesedgardata0001375365000137536524000036smci20241024htm

in late july 2024 ey communicated to the audit committee concerns about several matters relating to governance transparency and completeness of communications to ey and other matters pertaining to the companys internal control over financial reporting and that the timely filing of the companys annual report was at significant risk in response the board appointed an independent special committee of the board the special committee to review the matters and certain of the companys internal controls and certain governance procedures the review



after receiving additional information through the review process ey informed the special committee that the additional information ey received raised questions including about whether the company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with principle 1 of the coso framework about the ability and willingness of the audit committee and overall board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the ceo and other members of management in accordance with principle 2 of the coso framework and whether ey could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the audit committee in the resignation letter ey stated in part we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on managements and the audit committees representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management and after concluding we can no longer provide the audit services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations

sounds like management was lying to the auditors i would stay away at all costs  now im worried about palantir  most people did  or at least their profits got cut by a large margin

someone bought at ath at 123  just be glad you are not them  the suits that work at the sp are fully aware that the only thing thats propping up the market is the promise of ai if they delist smci the whole thing crumbles  is it because elon bad  managements representations were no longer considered reliable ie they were too shady and their auditors dont trust what management is telling them  if auditor find fraud or dont want to sign shady financial statement they are not allowed to tell anybody all they can do is resign  because they have their own problems and cant afford another reputation hit 
the penalty for inappropriately recognizing income is a fine on the order of tens of millions  how big is this supposed contract  what a trash company lmao   deadline was monday 18 nov feel free to read nasdaq rules  saturday the 16th is a bad business day so by rule the next good business day would be today as it is not a saturday sunday or federal holiday the company is all kinds of shady but they did not miss the deadline if they indeed filed today  incompetent or crooks i dont care

more often than not its both  i was looking for a gamble and almost went balls deep in some weeklies for this week on friday damn  taiwan isnt china  what are the 1220 80c worth right now  did not age well  why  palantir should be scrutinized considering the atrioc video  i bought in at 750 960 then was averaging down at 475 45  37 then sold it around there bought some at 20 because fuck it now gifemotefree_emotes_packcry  no

so as i said only volatility is guaranteed  i invested so i get solid gains each year since 2021 slowly and steady but once the stock goes up 200 in a year you get all these new bulls and bears  it depends on whether youre trying to invest or gamble youre right that at the end of the day one could say if it makes money who cares but at least in one youre buying for reasons beyond i hope someone else buys this for more than i paid but i dont know why  thats true you own it too  nasdaq rules on discipline state that the last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a saturday sunday or federal holiday in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a saturday sunday or federal holiday that gets you to the end of the next day which is today the 18th  so the market as it always has been right whats the problem if you have an issue with it take your money out and put it somewhere else the markets for everyone who can afford it i thought  take the green and move into another steady stock markets becoming volatile happens sometimes just do the ol switcheroo  sold half at 29  only have 2476 shares now  but the capital gains tax  this is how is should be pe too high protect your initial investment first learn to be happy with a win even with a small win and zen goodluck man  youd be paying them anyway eh",0.9965,0.9963,1

is this a mistake by etoro or is buying etfs from etoro somehow making the stock into a cfd  because etoro is a platform that trades cfds on securities you dont buy the actual underlying asset on their trading platform i dont think its a broker  i think i found my answer sorry i was not able to share that i am in the uk

 all us etf positions opened by clients of etoro europe ltd and etoro uk ltd who are residents of the eea or the uk are only available as cfds

todays sentiment by the trump administration is to release them from conservatorship it could be a 2050x pps jump next year ",kanoa700,2024-11-19 19:14:04,12,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1guxfrh/what_your_take_on_fmnafmcc/,,"the government holds warrants expiring in 2028 granting it the right to purchase up to 80 of fannie maes and freddie macs stock at an exercise price of 000001

exercising these warrants would require ending the conservatorship and allowing them to expire seems highly out of character for trump  very risky who knows what trump will do  unlikely a release from conservatorship will hurt too many people across all parts of the political spectrum also they will be forced to compete with everyone else and will not do well

while privatization may seem desirable in terms of protecting taxpayers the functional reality is that the
gses today perform functions that the private markets are unwilling to provide at least at current levels
of mortgage interest rates and equity returns as mentioned above the gses take market and credit risk
that private investors have so far been unwilling to bear with respect to the credit risk today there is no
significant market for taking first loss risk on single family mortgages other than prime loans held in
portfolio on the balance sheets of depository institutions  why the huge price run in last 60 days  i also bought this before the election with a similar thesis i clearly however bought way too little  same discussion was brought up last time when trump was first elected the secretary of treasury at the time said on tv that he was going to release fannie and freddie but it ended up being a nothing burger i know a lot of people lost money betting on that trade some speculated that they discussed fannie and freddie on purpose so that big boys who bought the stocks way back then can get out the better play is the preferred shares which they need to be redeemed at par or be converted to common stocks however volume is extremely low  so i agree with you that they would go up in value a lot if the government control changes but its really a big play on whether trump will push for it 

its possible but will he really push for it its not like its a hot button issue for his base  on the other hand on the list of things he could do its probably not that hard to push for 

i predict he just plays golf and focuses on other things instead  trump  trump didnt release them from conservativeship or even talk about it when he was president why will this term be different",0.5106,0.9728,1
Hold off on investing until February?,"is anybody working a waitandfindout strategy with investing right now

with the election and geopolitics being what they are and the markets going up and down ive heard some murmurs that everything is about to come crashing down if thats the case i would just want to hold what i have and then begin building again from that point forward 

does it make sense to keep working dca at this point some prices are low but could potentially drop way lower thinking about voo

thoughts i know you cant time the market and speculation isnt a science",Employee28064212,2024-11-20 18:15:48,0,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvoo6f/hold_off_on_investing_until_february/,,"i can only tell you once we get to february if this was a good idea  better to just invest the same amount weekly or monthly no matter the price 

time in market  timing the market  there will always be a reason to not invest lets go through the past 5 years

2020 covid

2021 covid variants

2022 inflationukraine war

2023 inflationukraine war

2024 election year

  
total return over these 5 years is over 100

blah blah blah just invest and forget about it  you cant time the market but you can assess your own risk tolerance and timeframes im personally starting to pare back some investments and hold more cash and have put off investing life in my taxable accounts i expect heavy volatility and im also sitting on gains which i can afford to harvest and repurpose either into a market dip or into other projects bottom line is i think this might be a good time for folks to assess their strategies check their liquidity positions and adjust if needed  no i invest year round and i take profits every quarter and i sell losers with a callous efficiency  asking myself the same question ive been partitioning my biweekly investments into vti and some long term bond funds this doesnt feel like the time to be aggressive just a sentimental take of n1 from a random redditor  no not good to wait you cant determine when to get in  the markers are always uncertain 

invest now invest wisely and take chances  yep kind of ive sold most of my sp 500 when it was at the highest recently and bought some safe as much as something can be safe french stocks im french i also bought some cryptos at the beginning of their craze so thats cool


my reasoning is i think that if trump applies his ideas its gonna be disastrous for the us economy so two possibilities

 he applies his ideas the us economy takes a hit im happy i made this decision

 something happens or im wrong and the us economy doesnt take a hit well ill rejoice maybe i will have lost some potential growth but id rather lose some potential money and not see the us  and the world  have a really really bad couple of years


so in a way its a win win im not the fomo kind so ill be sincerely happy if it all turns out for the best  wait and find out means youll be buying in at a higher price if the future looks good and a lower price of it looks bad the market largely accounts for risk so in reality youre not gaining anything  the best time to buy is always yesterday op  market is sketchy and cash is a position i think anyone thats not worried about a recession or at least hedging is a fool   the geopolitical situation of the world has never been great from the high standards that people seem to have recently adopted comparing the global situation to some vague utopian idea of the past that never existed we have more information of world events now and are being constantly bombarded with it and i think people confuse this with the world being a more unsafe place than it was in the past

things can always dip lower thats the nature of the game up to you if you want to neglect looking for good value companies for a few months but people constantly have gut feelings that something bad is going to happen to the market or the world and occasionally they do but acting on those feelings is generally not a good idea  markets are already heading down thanks to the tariff talk  nobody knows youre welcome  somewhat i keep my current portfolio invested but for the most part my new investments dollars are just being added to my emergency cash position for the moment  ive heard some murmurs that everything is about to come crashing down

where do you people come from lol our incoming president would literally kill all his children other than ivanka if it meant the stock market would go  

dont overthink things  why not wait until 2028  corz printing rn after approved deal in denton expansion  ill let you know in march  it depends on your age ill be 60 and plan to pair back stocks considerable in the new year  but if youre young just keep buying dont wait  lol this murmur you are hearing has been going on for the last 3 years why would it drop with trump in office it didnt when he was in office before  im just putting my money in gold stocks for now at least if there is a market boom id make gains if there is a recession ill also profit as well the market sentiment right now i feel is for everyone to buy as much stocks as you can before the inauguration as the whole market will repeat covid levels if everyone is expecting it the opposite usually happens i am counting on the entire market steadily increasing until january at aths then a huge drop off come february ill probably sell anything other than gold stocks at that point then buy back when it all tumbles we also can not forget that putin might try something desperate or iran blocking the suiz canal that will inflate the oil market and tear up the whole market apart  yes just dca i think going balls in would be a mistake see investors in 2021 who got shafted  im in the market daily seeing some fairly reliable stocks nosedive just made me question if i should take a break for a minute haha i dont cash out often so its always a question of the best place to park some cash   covid we actually saw a sell off the others we did not  arent election years usually much better years for assets  agreed i cant imagine being bullish on anything right now  the market can only account for knownapparent risk   deleted  agreed the pompous overconfidence that comes up in discussions like this is always wild to me lol  is gold a reasonable cash alternative  our incoming president and elon would also love to see some massive drops in order to buy things back up for pennies thats what elon meant when he talked about crashing it in order to build it back up  he was in office in 2020 and 2018 wasnt a good year  one word tariffs that leads to recession  no you wont  youre not investing you are trading you need to reevaluate your risk tolerance if red days make you question your investments  so you invest daily but are unsure why stocks go down sometimes  2022 so yeah we had a massive sell off 25 years as i said still total return of over 100  ah my 2022 meta position would like to have a word  read ops post lol  but that doesnt change the fact that the unknowns are just as likely to boost stocks as it is to weaken stocks  true thank you for the feedback  what about it sq docusign all pumped during covid too im not gonna cherry pick the market sp sold off

did you diamond hand through 2022  that was my point you said the market only tanked during covid and thats not true 2022 saw a massive dip across the board  yeah forgot about that one lol",-0.705,0.9923,-1

 the average retail investor is up just 37 yeartodate despite the historic market rally according to jpmorgan data

 by comparison the sp 500 is up 25 and is on track for its best election year in 88 years

 this marks retails worst annual performance for any year where the index saw a doubledigit return since 2015

groovy   anyone will be loading lly sub 700  anyone know why vrt is up 25 in two weeks it has been absolutely ripping lately  the dip from bad geopolitical news the day of russian invasion oct 7th today almost always reverses into green   the returns are fucking crazy when you step back and look at the chart

sp 500 since 14th october 2022 the market is up 65 

thats the same returns as from october 2014 to june 2020

its the same returns from november 2010 to march 2016  mstr 400 stock of the year more dilution  share higher only sezl can best it sezl x40 so far this year

buy high sell higher never wrong  odd having a bit of a selloff and the numbers are interesting 

theyre on track to be trading at 2122x 2024 net income they report in adjusted earnings which basically backs out sbc the sbc accounts for about 008share annually at this point so not nothing but not huge 

if they hit their stated goal of 20 growth next year that puts them around 1718x 2025 earnings which should be around 218share stock analysishttpsstockanalysiscomstocksoddforecast shows the consensus 2025 earnings at 169share so there is a potential mispricing there and by a large amount 

they also have several new products slated to be released in late 2025 so its very possible we see accelerated growth beyond that 

the company also is buying back stock which lessens the impact of the sbc ideally there would be less sbc and they could actually lower the share count but for such a young company i dont consider this a deal breaker  is this finally the pull back on lb 

the chart definitely looks like a low off top plus it was getting a crescendo of praise everywhere lockup ends in december iirc  stock shopping

long  just read an article that mentioned that meta was over owned and microsoft was under owned

could someone explain what the hell that means  do you guys think mstr will continue to go up throughout the week  nothing to buy everything is overpriced  aapl trades at a higher pe than msft

now they are against allowing inflation to fall below 2 after the recent period of high inflation in fact they are already declaring victory with the core inflation rate above 3  i know that to the market 2030 is an eternity away but i think the japansese mgm project is very much underhyped  my understanding is that asia is a massive gaming market and until this point japanese gambling is mostly relegated to roundabout pachinko games with no formal casinos

this project represents a major shift in japans gambling policy casinos were previously illegal in the country but a 2018 law provided exceptions for casino games in officially approved integrated resorts mgm osaka will be the first such resort to open making it a landmark development for japans tourism and gaming industries  app is finally taking off from here good bye 200  anyone got a few tickers they are reading up on i looked into a few but none of them seem a better buy than goog right now  so the markets reacting to this brand new russiaukraine war

wait what do you mean its been going on for almost three years now  nvda up 4 i just give up at this point  i was reading this httpswwwcnncom20211017europespanishfemalewriterrevealedintlscliindexhtmlarticle on cerebras llm processor last night cerebras is private but do we think their technology could pose any threat to nvidia at this point the article appears to try and make that case but to be honest i doubt nvidia isnt working on something similar  hasnt already considered the implications of cerebras work  anyone have a favorite robotics andor automation stock they think is worth looking into currently id like to add one to my portfolio  is a dip in mstr coming tomorrow not sure whens the right time to buy   i was just looking at transdigm tdg and saw that their retained earnings went from 342b to 736b in a single quarter despite having a positive net income can anyone please explain this  whats everyones thoughts on hims current price  with the shitload of otm call open interest on nvda this week nvda cant possibly go down right

i mean minimal chance eh  why avgo keep going down   people still only caring about pe as a reason to think stocks are highly valued

yall do know other metrics matter too

also low volume is not a reason to be bearish

look at naaim index and youll see most funds are neutral and probably waiting for nvda er for the 2nd leg up  so much for that lauded trump bump  lunr to 15  rklb to 25 gifemotefree_emotes_packmoney_face keep buying up  the only thing stopping the music at this point is a bad nvda earnings i mean they wouldnt they couldnt right  has anyone else been looking at aluminum with china cutting its tax rebate alcoa is already at the bottom of a cycle  bros were ditching nvda right based on technicals  is asml a buy sub 600  i bought 4 shares of vrt in may of 2023

i just want to sell now so i can stop feeling regret   what would happen with the market if nvda were caught cooking the books  but media said world was ending today  why is the market going up  thoughts on microsoft

the price is no that much active comparing to other big corps

experts and reports show its nice future and revenue

are you buying  if nvidia kills it tomorrow think there is any chance meta might get out of its funk

been in a funk for the past few weeks  kraken robotics and grab both up double digits today animal spirits alive and well  macau gross gaming revenue rose 66 yearoveryear in october to 208 billion patacas 26 billion to roughly match the consensus estimate from analysts the ggr tally was up 20 from the september total and was the highest since the pandemic shutdown in 2020 according to data from the gaming inspection and coordination bureau  interesting data out of macau chinese consumer maybe picking up a little tiny bit  trying to save up for a house what bondsmoney marketmutual funds should i go for if not going for etfs  this is just silly by stock futures considering that the most likely case is that the ukraine war is over by february i mean heck crude oil is not excited


the most likely case is that this was just going to happen anyway and now you do have to wonder if whether seasonality continues to fail to work into eoy  personally im getting an extra lot of bynd shares   you reckon djt to go up for inauguration and when trump starts his presidency  the most absurdly volatile name as of 819 it was up 106 ytd now 10 ytd

51610 100 61087 41 87819 71 8191119 56   wtf  trash stock  it is a bummer to me that rklb is full on degen now i really enjoyed the community around it of space fanatics when it was 4 now its overrun with gambling types  americas stress equals celsius success  yep  its an infinite money glitch until it isnt

when btc has another bear market mstr gonna get wiped out lmao  its a pyramid scheme  buy high sell higher dollar isnt real  

mstr buy high and hold forever  if you are talking about issuing debt to buy bitcoin those are convertible notes meaning that they are dilutive if the share price hits the strike point and they have already

how else do you think that they can borrow at 1 so easily  the value strategy hasnt panned out for me this year ive underperformed since july i feel like the crwd event was the first domino 

msft asml lvmuy and nxt have all been laggards for me since then  i am all cash after selling nvda and google i am not hurrying at these prices   what are your picks  dah record price increases being past on to the consumer especially groceries  after january prices will be inflated due to tariffs  i suspect they already have a plan to increase before hand so it is not as visible  

good investment for the immediate future  so annoyed i didnt hammer the august dip it was right on my watchlist at the time i bought cls around then so cant be too mad i guess  the investor day was yesterday presentation was positive  its somewhat ai but there still a ton of spending going into data centers and powercooling is a huge component of it 

i mean other names that work in hvac space around data centers are also seeing a ton of growth look at aaon mod fix as few for examples  i only bought 4 shares in may of 2023 like a freaking idiot  down like 18 in the ahs posted this earlier 

powl is reporting after the bell today will be interesting to see how the market reacts usually the past the stock pops a ton on earnings then trades flatsideways until pretty much the next report

feels like a bit of opposite this time and wonder if it might actually sale off of the recent run

cant predict them but the stock ran a ton into earnings and felt it it was setup to fail or at least just different than how its been trading in the past  according to broyhill asset management the average retail investor has only gained 36 per year over the last two decades thats remarkable considering the advantages individual investors should have in terms of liquidity and range of stock selection  im curious how they came to this conclusion especially since were in the era of passive investing and a huge chunk of retail is throwing money into sp index funds technically owning voo will underperform the sp over the long term due to the expense fee though

theres also a ton of people in this sub doing well above 3 this year so are they being countered by others yoloing into 0dte options or something  how much do we think is due to options gamblers blowing it all repeatedly  i cant find a source all the tweet says is jp morgan im curious if their calculated average factors in inactive accounts which skew it closer to 0  checks out beating the  stock market picking individual stocks is contingent on picking the few winners that outperform a lot which is incredibly difficult to do consistently

if you dont pick a winner then you likely underperfrom the spy since most of the spy gains are from these select few winners  no idea what do with takes like this sometimes i still remember in like 2022 when dimon was warning about an economic hurricane 

httpswwwcnbccom20220601jamiedimonsaysbraceyourselfforaneconomichurricanecausedbythefedandukrainewarhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20220601jamiedimonsaysbraceyourselfforaneconomichurricanecausedbythefedandukrainewarhtml

the spy is now up like 43 from that comment  well the guy does make his money by getting others to sell out of fear  ive been loading already one of the only companies i actually buy stock in outside of etfs  even though it still has an insane valuation  investor day yesterday was positive and while further back than two weeks i thought the earnings in the second half of october were good  you can use polymarket to see how likely people think a thing is going to be and the market reacts accordingly  tbh another big red line has crossed and russians are again talking about nukes 
seems everyone and the market shrugs it off understandablenot the first time they say it and probably not the last  now do since jan22  the shiller ratio right now for the sp 500 has not been this high since the dotcom bubble

im slowly rotating out of tech and into small caps

why do people think buffet is sitting on 300b in cash  still think it is worth buying more im up 63 so far on it  hoping it pulls back a little more than this biggest regret is that i didnt put in more initially  what the hell is keysight  no its not shown in current year revenue until its in the hands of the customers its shows up in balance sheet as a liability for nvidia  it will show as unearned revenue which is liability to nvda  dont get me started i keep thinking it wouldnt go then high but every day its been 50 jump so pissed i didnt go in on any day just any day  yes 

until it craters violently

most reliable bubble bursting signal is when it starts disconnecting even from corn nevermind reality itself  im gonna break out the voluuumer chart havent used it in a while  i remember in august and september people saying how the rally will fail because its low volume i dont see anything strange or exceptional about the breadth  time to short  maybe people saw your comment and decided to sell lol it tanked in the last 10 mins  i guess it means that either hedge funds or retail hold more of one than the other and in their opinion too much of one and not enough of the other im guessing the article was aimed at retail so my guess would be its just a bit of a silly way of saying people should buy msft and not meta  the stock market is at an ath most of the time  wmt had a good quarter

oh 46 pe for a retailer lmaooooo  there is not dead simple large cap usa stocks to buy you mean there are lots of stocks to buy but you have to put in the work you should not expect american large cap tech to be cheap during a bull marketmost of the time  come on  google  




this is both the answer as well as a command verb   msft asml xlv goog  pfizer is looking decent at these prices  bns my choo choo trains are doing bad   completely agree  i got an alert that pepsi hit a 52 week low on my yahoo alerts  i look at the stock and its still trading at 23 pe  buy high sell higher mstr  put your money in the market or watch it get eaten away by the expected inflation by the incoming us administration unfortunately were all at the behest of private equity firms trading algorithms  the momentum factor has outperformed every other factor this year stocks going up keep going up and vice versa look at the behaviour of stocks like nke el lvmh compared to stocks like ctas cost aapl and wmt the latter group are all obviously overvalued but liquidity trumps rationality when it comes to markets at the moment  inflation risk due to trump tariffs is pushing money into equities  also fund managers who performed poorly are trying to play catchup  i agree but ive also been thinking this since august wouldve made money if id bought then but instead here i am hoping we pull back to august levels 

dont forget tsla pltr avgo arm amd rddt v ma unh tmo dhr and just about every other stock on my watchlist all with skyhigh pe and peg ratios  i own all of the above mentioned have for years  will continue to hold for years  sell calls occasionally against aapl and wmt and when called away i sell puts to load back up  im up over 500 on aapl  theme for every company you cite is hold on and ride it out up or down  you mean taiwan and israel are all good now mr market stopped caring long ago  just my 02 but i wouldnt take the first red day as the opportunity to deploy all your cash in the sidelines i think well have lots of volatility ahead  because j pow is a fucking hack anything and everything to pump the markets  the gambling thing is really interesting world wide i remember seeing some news around brazil recently with it 

httpsapnewscomarticlesportsbettingbrazilcrisise199e0ef30228c15fd25820b1a69a900httpsapnewscomarticlesportsbettingbrazilcrisise199e0ef30228c15fd25820b1a69a900

i do think even in the us its an interesting problem i do think gambling should be legal but its kind of wild how you cant watch like any sports programming youtube or even on cable tv without some segment around betting  stock was at 67 1 quarter ago pretty sure it took off already  been buying some of the chip equipment makers right now i dont think its going to be a great trade in the short to mid term since we are still waiting for some of the markets to bottom like auto and industrial chips however a lot of come down in price and look solid for long term holds like amat lrcx asml onto nvmi 

this is an example of a screener i use 

httpsfinvizcomscreenerashxv111ffa_estltgrowth_o102cfa_peg_u22cfa_quickratio_o12cfa_roi_o102cfa_salesqoq_o5ft2oindustryhttpsfinvizcomscreenerashxv111ffa_estltgrowth_o102cfa_peg_u22cfa_quickratio_o12cfa_roi_o102cfa_salesqoq_o5ft2oindustry

i just start out with things like sales growth qoq over 5 since a lot of companies are seeing some slowdowns but still want to buy something that has sales growth i like look at eps growth over 5 years to see how good the management of the company is 

i like high roc so always start out with like 10 or change it to 15 personally i like companies with quick ratios over 1 so always start with that 

i also like trying to get things a good price so i start out looking with a peg of under 2 

so you end up with like 87 companies to start researching i suggest a lot of names or bring up anything i find interesting and basically comes from just screening  mgm xfab evvty infineon simo adyey and nbis  theres some canadian companies if your interested bns for example its a bank that bought an interst in key corp bank at 17xx descent potential for some gains  why didnt you buy it when it was cheapo  its up bc of the cooling problem with blackwell and concerns about sustainable growth

s  just buy more nvda only goes up will probably hit close to 200 soon

it also appears to be a safe play that stays green when the market is down  betting against the magnificent one is stupid nvda only go up something like 30 of the retail market owns share way too much investment into this one stock for it to fail  just wish i had bought more than 34 shares 

would have taken some of my meta stock to do it 

my hope is that if nvidia kills it tomorrow meta might get out of its funk  nvidia has definitely considered cerebras fullwafer direction i have no idea what their conclusions were besides the fact that if they thought it was the right move theyd be doing it and maybe they are for some future product


ive liked cerebars since i first saw the taken down youtube video of the lab lady going over the engine block of a system it is innovative strictly in the sense that it disrupts a lot of the statusquo of system design having so many cores on a single wafer changes your networking demands which necessarily will change everything else id guess some parts are easier and some harder but considering how much nvidia ip surrounds the main chip in their systems it is probably significant


it will pose no greater threat than all the hyperscaler asics imo the truly hard part of what nvidia does is the extreme focus on compatibility across the stack and generations as well as the ability to disaggregate the reference design to ensure a good fit for any and every datacenter owner and all of the software suites and developments they release to reach all the way to the enduserresearcher empowering them to use accelerated computing with minimal effort


besides pure inference datacenters which are likely to be asics designed for wellunderstood and commercially viable models all of these extra things nvidia brings to the table makes them an amazing choice to fill up your dc  if any given user base falls off usage for one reason or another the compute supply is easily soaked up by all the other applications that can run on nvidia systems giving great roitco a busy dc is a profitable dc



hyperscalers wouldnt by buying as much as they are at the prices they pay if it didnt make sense including medium to longterm as dc build outs must return value for many years and if it were so easy to compete with nvidia for this demand amd would be doing a lot better than they have it is no longer speculative to say nvidias moat is both wide and deep it is empirically true and with their new hoardes of cash for reinvestment i cant imagine anyone catching up without serious errors from nvidia  for automation plays i like a few industrial names like ait itt itri and aph  put leaps  buy high buy higher  i am mad i didnt buy more yesterday probably still a good price but i just feel im chasing  depends options max pain usually control a lot of stuff but if big institutes move the stock cuz of some good or bad earnings they can move the market like nothing else  normal reaction if nvda er is good it may go back up pe is to high for me   all the me too just cant keep up w the king  i agree fcf yield priceocf evs all have their uses using ttm pe is so cringe to me it will lead you astray both ways  us stocks are at very high valuations regardless of what metric you use   look at naaim index and youll see most funds are neutral and probably waiting for nvda er for the 2nd leg up

9160 is high neutral with a bullish tilt is 6070 naaim exposure index rarely drops below 60 unless its a bear market or the market has corrected  i mean im no trump fan but since late october im up like 10 but since the big jump its been mostly flat  sp is up a third of a percent why lie  my ta shows the following for nvda

there is a daily fvg fair value gap that is support that it is sitting in

there is a daily fvg resistance that it is also sitting in

so i have no fucking clue its just gathering liquidity today for a move in either direction p  technicals dont matter a day before er  nvda is the mega cap with the highest growth potential in the near future even with its slowing growth rate  as long as you look long term asml confirmed their 2030 guidance like last week during their investor day i do expect the equipment makers to be pretty bumpy in action in the short to mid term but long term its not a bad price  at 24 pe its a buy even now   i keep catching the knife it keeps dropping i keep buying  my brother works in that industry and cant say enough good things about the interactions hes had with them its been on my watchlist for too long and jumped in today oh well long term hold  would be red for one day then a week straight of green to new aths  nothing ever happens  did it ever say world is perfectly fine nothing to see here  deleted  why not  hell yeah im buying im dcaing every paycheck  i wonder if its funky bc theres a perception that the orange turd doesnt like zucky  threatened to jail him after all  but much as i dislike them both and would love to see a cage match to the death that reason seems like performative bs trump owes as much to fb as to any other platform  yea man what a funk now its only up almost 70 in the past year  wonder if its from sym earnings  hysa  sgov  it doesnt change anything the market response is rather muted all things considered  you couldnt tell by looking at the precious metals or oil other commodities are flat hell bonds havent moved

the housing starts matter more  ukraine war over by february what makes you say that  most likely case is that the ukraine war is over by february

highly skeptical even the us aid that has been approved has been trickling in very slowly while ukraines defense industry has been ramping up and becoming more self sufficient over the past 3 years which means that ukraine has been fighting with minimal us aid as it already is also its possible trump will prefer that ukraine bomb russian oil refineries in order to boost global demand for us oil i could definitely be wrong but a lot of military analysts ive been listening to say that us aid isnt as crucial now as it was earlier on in the war  why have you ever tried their burgers i have it tasted awful and ive tried a lot of alternative meat products i also like meat so definitely not the case that its too meat like for my taste either just was a terrible product with much better alternatives available and the stock price reflects that  that stock didnt even hit a new 52 week high when trump won im not touching it with a stick  yeeeeehhbhaaawwwww i sure hope so i got me hogs all mortgaged up sayin itll be
hoping to upgrade me trailer  eh its ok wm is a trash stock 

i mean to comment more on finchat than the stock itself i actually made ea little money on it though so im biased  most of the individual stocks subs go that way shame really  so what happens when the share price doesnt meet the strike point  will he keep borrowing by selling shares  then what   nxt i still think is a good long term value pick msft has truly been a laggard in many ways despite being a mag 7 stock  i can tell you my main laggards have been solar stocks i still hold a good amount of tech in the form of avgo googl meta and nvda lly has been taking a beating since the rfk announcement too 

i also bought into dhi at 120 but since it peaked its been shitty  happens i did get some in august was a really great buying opportunity crazy its up like over 80 since around then  only down 4 now very volatile agree u cant predict  indeed but other factors such as bad timing position sizing overtrading taxes commissions and slippage all impact performance as well   theres also a ton of people in this sub doing well above 3 this year 

comment section is a small percentage of the overall sub also people are known to exaggerate or selectively share good years but not bad years  im double as smart    at 66 thanks smci   if it included inactive accounts retail wouldnt have disproportionately fallen during the august correction they were buying highly speculative tickers at the top most likely in the nasdaq   beating the stock market picking individual stocks is contingent on picking the few winners that outperform a lot which is incredibly difficult to do consistently

thats a halftruth most of your portfolio returns will be derived from a select few stocks but its not difficult to construct one where the majority of inclusions run neck and neck with the sp it boils down to choosing outside of that limited index  i dont doubt hes an expert on the financial world but i am skeptical on his qualifications to comment about war  little did we know the economic hurricane was investors standing in a money booth surrounded by flying bills   would you do me a kindness and tell me what are the other few single stocks you buy   what top 10 market cap stock doesnt have an insane valuation  thanks for the input i actually wasnt aware of investor day despite owning a whopping 1 share lol

i know theyre not direct peers but i find it interesting that vrt has been rocketing while anet has been drowning since earnings despite beating expectations the latter is always conservative with forward estimates theyve beat estimates something like 40 quarters in a row and the market reacted severely it did have a nice run up before earnings but it seems like a matter of time before anet goes bonkers again  a big red line hasnt been crossed this is just the narrative that russia are peddling ukraine have been fighting this war on behalf of the eu and us as well as themselves the whole time all this has done in reality is weaken russia they are constantly bombarding ukraine with missiles and hoped that ukraine would not be able to respond in the same way of course they are threatening with nukes this is what they do every time something doesnt go the way he wants expects giving in to his wild threats wont help if hes dumb enough to use nukes because of something like this then its inevitable but conceding to them indefinitely every time they threaten that would be very stupid and only give them the upper hand theyre hoping for  the sp 500 tr index ie including dividends is up about 30 since peak 2021 levels over 3 years that comes out to about a 9 cagr

thats roughly the same return as the sp 500 has returned the past century if i recall right not bad given that was relative to bubbly valuationsdca bros did much better of course  the reason brk is sitting on so much cash is probly not the reason you or i think it is  i hope so too no regrets though i avoid ipos and will continue to do so it works more often than not  electronics measurement and test equipment manufacturer 26b market cap pretty large company for what they do  thank you  thanks  wouldnt short a momentum market like this  but definitely concerning since breadth has been pretty weak in recent weeks  all the cnbc experts said small and mid caps would outperform big cap techstill hasnt happened  rotating from tech into small cap etfs is the best move i think

barring a total reversal on inflation i think the stage is set almost perfectly for a russell 2000 run  lol it is a little thinly traded still not sure how many people even know yandex relisted so long as it stays above 15 by december i am happy with my sold puts  that was kind of where the article was heading i think but it didnt mention retail

while meta is more expensive its not as if microsoft is cheap for individual investors  that is a very good counterpoint to the stock being over valued arguement if you are only buying a sp 500 index fund  but using that arguement to buy individual stocks can lead to massive loses  walmex much better value here growing faster close to atl fwd pe  nope not putting money in the market with risk reward this skewed to the downside i have my stock im long and the rest is in sgov and waiting for a sqqq entry that will seemingly never come lmao  yeah no ill just invest in international and small cap value stocks  yeah but who are the reetards buying higher and higher pe 

fund managers  yea dollar cost average it in from now till the end of the year  not the first red day weve been down for a week  yea the morality around it is certainly not my favorite part especially with which economic demographics actually play the most however mgm and evvty are both cheap enough that i have been quite a bit plus mgm has reduced outstanding shares by 40 in a few years with no price movement atm  anecdotally here in australia ive seen school kids on the bus on sports betting apps  agree but what should i phrase it now haha  200 would add a trillion in market cap    i appreciate you taking your time to write such an insightful response i really appreciate it i agree nvidia will stay on top and if they needed more money for research and development theyd have no shortage of money to do it with  i think everyones received your wisdom at this stage you can give it a rest now  really market is only 5x my estimate of 2043 earnings seems pretty cheap if you ask me and this isnt sensitive to my choice of interest rates whether i go as high as 1 or low as 3  market can stay reetarded longer than i can stay bearish  its reminded at these levels for awhile so imo unless nvda shits the bed market moves higher  the fact they can even discuss 2030 guidance and not get laughed at by analysts says something about the business  its so frustrating dude bought at 18 a share gonna have to buy more i guess  highly doubt it  this guy stocks  thank you

its difficult to keep calm at this kind of market situation msfts stock isnt much reactive like others  20 in the last 6 months and down between 45 in the last month 

i still remember november of 2022  i think kraken might be up due to russia they are more defense contractormilitary than sym but it could also be sector related too for sure  only have 1000 right now  not trying to get political but there are lots of people who think trump has a magic wand we will see  i will be absolutely stunned if they are not forced to the negotiation table for something like what ended the finnish winter war freeze the fronts very soon


is it what i want no


but its absolutely what id expect and heck while i cant immediately bring it up z has talked about the war ending soon   even the us aid that has been approved has been trickling in very slowly while ukraines defense industry has been ramping up and becoming more selfsufficient over the past 3 years which means that ukraine has been fighting with minimal us aid as it already is

ukraine does not have a defense industry it doesnt have the prerequisite workforce or the capital inflows to run one this is mostly media hopium to avoid acknowledging the us has little material aid to provide

 also its possible trump will prefer that ukraine bomb russian oil refineries in order to boost global demand for us oil

bad take urals heavy sour cannot be substituted with american light sweet  

 i could definitely be wrong but a lot of military analysts ive been listening to say that us aid isnt as crucial now as it was earlier on in the war

a lot of military analysts are now admitting that the war is effectively over theyre a bit late to the party as the decisive period ended years ago we are in the theater stage of the endgame  haha yes i like their products and they had a pretty good year rolling out some new concepts i dont enjoy red meat

the meat industry isnt sustainable and people will run towards alternative proteins when the next meat supply chain crisis occurs

i am aware the stock is currently tumbling many companies are in the red this week 

bynd as a whole may or may not make it and ive accepted that risk for now im invested and think they remain viable for the foreseeable future  that or just write more convertible notes to pay the expiring ones  thats such a wild swing yeah with this one just felt like the pattern has been different and felt weird going into earnings  and theyre entrenched habits as well investing success boils down to psychology at the end of the day  i talk about my 103 2022 a lot more than my 30 2023 xd

edit 42 ytd so far  there are plenty of regulars here whom i know their portfolio holdings as much as you can from talking to people theyre doing fine  there was a study a while ago and the best investors were people that had forgotten about their investments  i agree just even being an expert on the financial world doesnt mean you can predict what will happen in the stock market 

i dont doubt that dimon is extremely smart and being the ceo of a bank gives you great insight into a ton of the world just of recent he doesnt have the best track record with saying things about what will happen in the market  lly jpm amzn goog 

other than that just etfs  google   you dont burn the house down before robbing it

this entire enterprise has just made russia look very very badly 

cant even win a conventional war against little ukraine now they need north koreans to do their fighting for them   thats roughly the same return as the sp 500 has returned the past century if i recall right

yep thats exactly the point i wanted to highlight does that 9 figure account for inflation  and how much of that 30 growth since the 2021 bubble peak is caused by an increase in eps vs pe expansion

its fucking wild that pe expansion is responsible for most of the rally off the 2021 highs when pes were already at record highs outside of rare select periods in history  that plus buffett can be a bs artist too him saying it is for tax efficiency is mostly just smoke  thoughts on the earnings tho what makes you so bullish  heh cnbc experts always inverse them  if we get more rate cuts that would be good for russell  however if tariffs are put in place causing inflation then we wont see cuts  too much is not known at this time  yea plus a random comment on reddit probably doesnt move a stock

there was a time though that people would scrape the stock subs and give data on the most mentioned tickers back in 2021 havent seen it happen in years though would be interesting if someone did this for 2024 i imagine there is a new generation of tickers rklb seems like something from that 2024 list if there was another  you mean purely in terms of the price of the stock rather than valuation metrics  almost everything is better value than wmt at these prices lol  in brkb we trust  fair i was being hyperbolic but my point stands sp is flat over the last month and up 24 ytd obviously anything can happen but i very much doubt this is as low as the market sinks over the next year  totally i mean you bring up a really solid point and im not against gambling by any means i do think there needs to be some type of regulation around it since there is probably a lot of people struggling with it even with stocks it feels like part of the reason why there is the 25k rule around day trading is really to protect the consumer  phase 2 booster

i finally got on board last week after long watching its ascent better late than never  yea this sub isnt for me lol  thatsdemonstrably falsehttpsnaaimorgprogramsnaaimexposureindex this year where the stock markets gains have been almost entirely based on multiple expansion it has averaged around 7677 the fact that theyre not at nosebleed levels 100 doesnt mean funds are neutral but 9160 is not telling us theres an imminent pullback either  well when a purchase from amsl costs like 380m i do think how companies plan to spend in the future does matter lol 

still blown away with the amount of engineering that goes into something like this

which analysts are you listening to the ones ive been listening to are saying otherwise  maybe they have some better products than what i tried i hope so meat alternatives im interested in investing in as an industry but im not interested in buying bynd from my experience or the financial numbers im seeing  there are 8m people in the sub likely a bit of survivorship bias  as embarrassing as it is to admit it im actually proof of that almost 20 years went by and that account gained an astonishing amount  part of the reason why is the firm will need to hoard more cash on the balance sheet to cover unexpected losses on natural disasters this is not the first time berkshire has had a large cash pile compared to their enterprise value if i recall  im bullish on the company because they own very valuable and useable land and have an insanely long runway on monetizing it 

i dont own it because its trading at obscene valuations right now and it just ipod in june  think so lol but i dunno thats why i am asking

had never heard the term before  true i suppose but walmex is mexican walmart so its like you are getting the brand  faster growth for less with the offset of more risk and gov antitrust hanging over them still  buy high buy higher  if you just want to spam with bad advice repeatedly then id agree if you want to engage in some sort of reasoned discussion occasionally then it could be  yea asianometrys coverage of asml sold me on buying its like alien tech come to earth  yeah youre right might put in a couple of thousand then and just go for long term  oh definitely 35 average just seems suspect with the amount of indexing  what price are looking at for an entry  theres various ways of measuring how expensive companies are trading at for example to do with how much money they make compared to their market cap meta share price is higher but is cheaper than msft by most valuation metrics but that alone doesnt necessarily mean you should pick one over the other have to consider if they deserve that premium because of future demand etc 

but people dont usually pay that much attention to the actual stock price when comparing which company to buy it only matters in relation to the companys own financials  its insane like the company hires physics engineers in order to problem solve 

httpswwwasmlcomencareersworkingatasmlunitedstatestechnicalfieldcomputerscienceandphysicshttpswwwasmlcomencareersworkingatasmlunitedstatestechnicalfieldcomputerscienceandphysics  even still retail investors are known to sell lowbuy high bad timing with etfs can still result in poor performance compared to the index  i dunno exactly just letting things shake out for awhile  very true i know peter lynch said that most investors in his find actually lost moneywhich is nuts",0.9648,0.9999,1
Trading SPY for gains,"first time posting long time lurking

i had some money 8k only sitting at a hysa and earning 4 interest
decided to buy 8k spy and harvest profit on a day to day basis meaning if stock goes up i withdraw gains if it goes down i do nothing

my hys was returning 25 per month i made 60 in 2 days and kept 8k on spy

what am i missing here even if i stop now and dont sell for the whole month i still did better than hysa 

are there tax implications or complications for realizing lots of micro short term gains 
i believe the tax bracket of hysa and short term gains is the same 
will my tax be too complicated to file if i keep doing these micro profit withdrawals

honestly i am a new investor trader have been doing index funds and nvda for less than 1 year 401k solid maxed out every year for 8 years

8k is the only around 10 of my liquid investment not counting 401k etc

thanks for any feedback",bourbon_nobruob,2024-11-20 10:56:11,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvicis/trading_spy_for_gains/,,"buy  hold long term is more effective than buying and selling and doesnt incurr as much taxes youre not going to successfully time the market  you need to know the difference

investing  passive you invest and you leave it the money works for you

trading  active you have to plan out a trading strategy monitor the price movement and enter and exit base on your strategy some traders can make few 100 gains and some lose a it all  hold for a year and youll pay way less taxes  decided to buy 8k spy and harvest profit on a day to day basis meaning if stock goes up i withdraw gains if it goes down i do nothing

this is called trading or swing trading or day trading 95 may be 99 who knows of retailers make loss by doing this not a good option if you do not know how to trade  

it is not easy as market always cheats the retailer it is long way to go

like others said buyhold index funds are better or stay as is in hysa until you learn properly which is better for you  just hold it forget it about lol way less stress  day trading spy   short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income so look at your marginal tax bracket thats the rate that you will be taxed if you dont know what a bunch of the terms i used are then you have no business trading  plenty of people tradedaytrade spy thats what i do with 10 of my account the other 90 is in voo and voo i dont touch  youre gonna need to learn about 0dte spy options  keep doing it daily and it wont be worth it and any profit will be handed over to uncle sam and his irs buddies come next year taxes is not joke when a regular joe that works a blue collar job gets hit with capital gains tax a few years in a row you tend to let stuff just chill  thank you for the feedback

so ya i am trading 8k for micro gains with zero intentions to cash out with less than 8k but will be cashing out as soon as it makes 50 on a given time of the day 

does that still make sense  i have been investing in index funds this year with a brokerage have only invested 401k before 

investing on fxiax and fsptx
this spy play is done with hysa money since i dont see the downside of doing it as long as i commit to keep the baseline starting money and harvest the small gains moving the gains back to money market or even hysa

the downsides i have been hearing applies for an overall portfolio my case i wanted to keep this cash liquidish hence i didnt add to index fund

wondering if anyone ever done such thing and proscons when tax time comes  haha putting it like that sounds stupid in fact haha

i guess this is a money i was leaving at a hysa just in case i needed not investing it long term
it was earning 25 per month in interest feels like spy trading would be as safe as it gets to get started
the problem is that i have these stupid questions related to taxes and if its worth it when compared to hysa  thank you 
i knew that part but i dont have short term capital gains at the moment and didnt know how difficult my tax filing will become if i start trading
hysa interest are also taxed as ordinary income but i believe they go in different places when filing taxes schedule d for capital gains
anyways i am newbie to this but not completely uninformed just wondering how come anyone would keep playing with hysa when spy or an index fund for that matter has always gone up overtime at rates better than hysa not considering big catalyst like a pandemic 
i am 34 years old so i got some time until i need to move my money to safe heaven  and do you do something similar than what i mentioned above by chance keep a baseline always there and only sell the excess

very new to trading and just thought it would be a better opinion to hysa just dont know how complicated my tax will be and if overall when comparing the hysa its more profitable looks like it had to be at least in bullish markets  ya paying tax is not the problem filling the tax returns is the question

i already take a 3537 hit due to taxes which is what the short term gains will cost me anyways 
not blue collar worker here but sorry to hear you got hit so much with capital gains tax  it does not make sense learn these

greediness kills

fear of missing out

fear of losing money

both will make you loss

investing or hysa is better way  it just means your investment will not be that great in the next 10 years as you keep withdrawing from your pool btw you should hold voo instead if you plan on holding it long term due to the cheaper expense ratio  i have many years of investing and some years of trading experience altogether 10 years it is very difficult to supersede buyhold of index funds over a long time most of my networth came by this way still holding by long term investment tightly 

now i am financially free stage to try my luck in trading have my tools in place nicely still market cheats trapped many times 

even though i am trying to break that rule like you past eight years trading it is hard to understand markets

see here how my algorithm pointed today httpsimgurcom94lvvdhhttpsimgurcom94lvvdh appx 635 am to 720 am pst it indicated market is turning 

even with nice system like this which is not visible for normal eyes unable to exceed market

all i say it is extremely hard to understand and make money in the market with exceptionally better tools

for begineers like you it is easy to blow out 8k with in fews month i just do not want another person get into a messy life hence wrote all these

finally it is up to you to decide what to do good luck",0.9612,0.9978,1
S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"the sp 500 index rebalancing occurs 4xyear with the next one coming up sp globalhttpswwwspglobalcomen announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed



sp rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be addedremoved as there is typically a 510 price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying  a positive brand bump



although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here sp 500 criteriahttpswwwspglobalcomspdjiendocumentsmethodologiesmethodologyspusindicespdf there is a bit of thematic flexibility by definition the index is a market capweighted index of us large and midcap stocks typically companies need to be 18b or larger in market cap and historically profitable



below is the sp 500 index sector weighting as of nov 14

technology 3332  financial services 1319  consumer cyclical 1080  healthcare 1054  communication services 903  industrials 758  consumer defensive 556  energy 344  utilities 254  real estate 217  basic materials 183

another angle could be emerging industries like ai infrastructure companies diving into scalable ai solutions such as kinetic seas with their purposebuilt data centers are becoming increasingly relevant in techheavy indices like the sp 500 while they may not meet the current market cap requirements yet these kinds of players could be the next wave of candidates in the coming years

curiouswhats your take on sector balancing do you think the index will continue leaning heavily into tech or will we see a more even distribution  i sure wish i had bought more vrt three days ago when you posted thisnice work op despite some of the comments above  volume is a requirement also 


 my target candidates 


the criteria isnt objective and the information is certainly not public these negotiations happen behind closed doors with water tight ndas its mafia game because all actively managed funds are benchmarked to this index so they usually favor ridiculously or randomly priced stocks  with volume frenzy like pltr or uber in early 2024 


so if you want to guess please look at volumes too  no mstr  they all look like theyve made relatively big moves already is there still an opportunity to be made  why not buy app also typically will the pump come before or after index inclusion  are you saying there is typically a 510 increase for those companies or for the sp  yesssss please we need vertiv in the sp500 i definitely dont have a large amount of vrt shares  i think kkr is more likely than apo and ares to get in if they let in a new pe firm  so what exactly do i do in this situation im pretty new to investing and want to learn more on it  just so you know the big players already have huge positions they build up over time to sell to whoever manages the listed index they pay a lot of money for this info and you are going to have a bad time trying to beat them  no problem its pretty simple to get a list of eligible companies you can use finviz to create a screener and filter for us market cap etc to fulfill the sp 500 requirements  exactly a surprise to me as well they have also shown good momentum recently im in more like im doubling down  stocks removed from the sp500 have performed better than additions  yeah definitely i havent done much research into the deletions side but yeah you can buy a basket of add candidates and short a basket of deletions candidates

heres a great resource for worst ytd sp500 performers 
slick chartshttpswwwslickchartscomsp500performancegoogle_vignette  i like your thinking and yeah its definitely a musical chairs game haha

in terms of sector balance i think it will remain heavily tech focused i think industrials and financials will get a priority in the next 25 years with interest rates coming down and the potential political policy to bring back us industrial and manufacturing no doubt energy as well with the insane demand from big tech aicompute and even crypto mining  this reads like chatgpt  thanks cheers  volume is factored in already this is filtered to include avg volume of 250k or greater   

my ideas are  like you said  just my ideas none of this is financial advice or a guarantee 

provide your own research or idea rather than stating the obvious  i doubt it because if the volatility and it trades with btc  oh also they have negative trailing eps gotta have positive eps for last 4 quarters 

httpsfinanceyahoocomquotemstrfinancialshttpsfinanceyahoocomquotemstrfinancials  not guaranteed but historically additions get a solid 5  move momentum is actually a good thing and can be a factor for index inclusion 

more important is probably the companys beta with the market and with nvda for example vrt trades closely with nvidia and so if you buy this week ahead of er and nvda sells off vrt might too just food for thought since the rebalancing wont occur for 23 weeks  app was up like 200 recently after er and idk seems like potentially too volatile for the selection committee i could be wrong though 

there might be some price increase in anticipation of the inclusion but if theres a real pump it will be after the announcement typically ah on friday lol 

so stocks get some momentum ah and then the following week  for the companies  gifemotefree_emotes_packmoney_face  kkr was already added in june  basically capitalize on the market swings for a positive catalyst like being included in the sp which forces funds to buy x amount shares so you can potentially buy a few shares of the suspected companies op has highlighted or buy call options  whos trying to beat them anyone can do research pick a stock and invest in it if it goes up it goes up and you make money nothing about what you said changes things 

this is a trade to benefit from companies that get increased trading volumebuying pressure when added to the index  why would that be  if i gave any legit research id be accused of having inside info if i stated something obvious its already be priced in


i prefer to treat reddit as its meant to be for entertainment  thanks for the amazing post i now follow you sir  based on sp calendar isnt the inclusion planned for 20 dec will the announcement be so early  figured as much thank you  so js buy the stocks op has highlighted and what are buy call options   talking down to me when you didnt comprehend what i just wrote the insider increased buyingvolume is already happening what you see on index addition is retailactive managersetc you need to be buying well beforehand otherwise youre basically doing a coin flip on whether the stock goes up or down just like any other day

i work in this industry btw how do you think these massive funds make money they use the guidelines to predict what will be addedremoved next rebalance about 100000x more info than you have and then buy the shares to sell to whoever is listing the index they are not all buying on the day it gets announced the only indexes that somewhat follow the behavior you imply is russel and thats why everyone hates them  most likely the value premium stocks being added have often seen huge surges in valuations prior to addition and removals have seen huge surges in decline prior to being removed

then you have people trying to sellbuy before the rebalancing that exacerbate this mispricing  he left out the over time part not initially maybe thats obvious to you or people reading but i thought clarifying could be helpful  fair enough id say reddit can also be a great source of information and idea sharing  httpswwwnysecompublicdocsice_nyse_2024_yearly_trading_calendarpdfhttpswwwnysecompublicdocsice_nyse_2024_yearly_trading_calendarpdf

announcement is 1st friday of dec look at indexes section for sp  this isnt the best place for these types of questions id think youre better of using some public resources to gain some familiarity on the vernacular used in this subreddit  you literally said im trying to beat something or someone thats wrong no one is trying to beat hfs or the market or the index selection committees

you are correct that for this trade to have any alpha one has to buy ahead of time which is why im posting this now a few weeks ahead of the announcement 

the point is to have a small group of stocks with potential inclusion as accurate as one can get without being a quant firm and then sell the news as always i could be wrong and this is just my speculation cheers  ahh yeah that makes sense though ive often wondered if the sheer increase in outside volatility and reduction in fundamental correlation might be enough to mildly depress a price in the long term as in maybe some stock pickers would rather trade high quality assets that arent tied as tightly to the movements of the broader market  i got that but im still curious if there is a correlation or what the reason might be if any  mstr  you kinda are trying to beat them bc youre implying they are leaving money on the table that you will be able to get a piece of based on vibes of what will be added these funds pay lots of money to know what will be added well before you do this is a crowded market and its not retail making it crowded  doubt it theres a level of healthy skepticism around a company thats so volatile and trades with btc regardless of if bitcoin is pumping  deleted  hey man if you want to lie to yourself its all good you are implying youre gonna beat them how else would you explain why you could make money off this trade why wouldnt the institutions make the same trade you are if its such a good trade youre saying that you know better than them and can squeeze additional money out of this trade reliably why wouldnt citadel have already done this trade if its so good

what you are doing is the same as buying before earnings to bet on the outcome its gambling

the fact you think its insider trading means you are completely clueless jumping from a sink into the pacific ocean  deleted",0.9661,0.9997,1
QUESTION: Warren Buffet annualized returns without Apple?,"warren buffet has an average annualized 20 return for over the last 5 decades but what would be his adjusted average returns if he never invested in apple im curious to know how key apple was to his success 

i have been trying to google all morning for this but googles search engine only shows recent articles about how warren buffet has dropped apple from his portfolio im sure theres a study or article somewhere thats done the math ",WellWe11Well,2024-11-18 20:53:18,96,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gu76al/question_warren_buffet_annualized_returns_without/,,"while berkshires longterm performance has been stellar theres evidence of underperformance in more recent years

from 1965 to 2002 a 38year period berkshires compounded annual return was 2566 compared to the sp 500s 1002

however from 2003 to 2022 a 20year period berkshire slightly underperformed the sp 500 delivering a 975 compounded annual return compared to the sp 500s 980

i believe aapl was added in 2016

cant add my source for this due to domain  search warren buffett has underperformed the stock market for the last 20 years

bumpedin  isb  cfa
published apr 27 2023  its important to note because i feel like this is kind of an attempt to discredit him that managing other peoples assets needs to take a more conservative approach than just yoloing the clients money into the sp 500  always remember that berkshires portfolio has grown far too large for warren to make positions in companies he would love to make  he has stated this many times for years  they are restricted to mostly big blue chips  also i think warrens approach to berkshire evolved from beating the sp500 to being a great steward of other peoples money   i dont get it why not search what he wouldve annualized if you picked out his worst investment such a useless hypothetical whats in the portfolio is in the portfolio  this is silly

you cant just throw out one of his most successful stock picks  impossible to tell if not aapl it would have been another likely great company they would have put their money into  it would not have been treasury bonds  but still i get your question its hard to know exactly because it looks like they bought and sold aapl multiple times  he just acquired apple recently considering this is over 50 years i dont think apple would account for half of the gains my guess is 15  deleted  warren buffet doesnt make any picks  its not 1990  he makes like 750 million a year in coca cola dividends alone  it doesnt matter because if he hadnt invested in apple he would have invested in something else what if he had done something thats performed better than apple  were buffett and munger really ever as good as they were touted to be or were they just products of opportunity to begin with anyone who started investing when they did would have had the opportunity to buy all these blue chips in their absolute infancy and realize 1000 gains when hardly anything in the world existed they lived through the golden age of invention and capitalism  keep in mind hes been something like 20ish bonds as well in theory they should potentially be compared to an  8020 portfolio  mr buffett and munger did a fantastic job when berkshire was a relatively smaller large cap  at the start of 2003 it had a market cap of 104 billion  the law of large numbers started to kick then for a modestly growing company  it is remarkable that with its huge size berkshire has been able to be so close to the sp 500 since 2003  but if you are looking for future outperformance you need to look elsewhere  gotcha thank for the search term interesting read  he sold off tsmc in mid2023 when it was around 90100 so fact that he sells doesnt mean its a dud stock id still hold onto apple 

he bought ulta in mid2024 around 400 its been mehstock so far frankly hes losing it  yeah and the funds goal may not even be beating the sp500 i dont know what the goal is but im sure it aint beating it 

some people care about beta and sortintino and drawdowns and volatility or whatever the hell else personally i just care if im beating the sp500 or not  he is not managing other people money it is a float for insurance businesses berkshire is not asset management other insurance companies more or less invest mostly in fixed income

i am not sure what the hell everyone around here is talking about berkshire delivers consistent returns on equity which is what matters  its of course hard when you are big and you still try to avoid most tech stock which are the majority or very large position of the available stocks to invest  the issue is it supposedly wasnt his pick if the majority of his gains arent from his own brain that matters  after adjusting buffets stats removing outliers to project the future he heavily regresses to around the level of 2018 kramer  11b  2682 apple price 2016  22882 apple current price
 938b

during that time berkshire went from 194k to 706k 

im not sure i follow now what  this is the key distinction that everyone is missing  on a risk adjusted basis brk is practically untouchable  not even close berkshire currently only holds 16 billion in bonds so 16 of its 1 trillion market cap brks cash position is nearly 20 times the size of their bond holdings  i followed him with oxy and am hurting because of it  he missed many of the tech gains that drove the sp 500 over the last 20 years because of his long time aversion to tech stocks he was somewhat late to apple but still in time to rack up massive gains from it  i almost bought ulta when he did its in the 350s now i do still believe its undervalued but being right at the wrong time is the same as being wrong  its about risk management when the sp500 returns 50 berkshire will return 15  the goal is consistent growth  yeah i shouldnt have made him sound like a fund manager hes not directly managing peoples money but i think thats being pedantic about the idea being conveyed hes not trying to maximize his gains hes trying to keep a healthy balance of minimal losses and healthy gains  but if hes going to die soon isnt it good that he trusts his managers to make good picks i still dont see the issue  doesnt matter he is the one that had to make the final decision  you cant throw out outliers buffet is all about outliers he doesnt believe in diversification  sorry i changed my response as i saw they bought on several occassion so we would need the full list of their transactions  im not even sure if thats public information  youre looking at the wrong thing i think thats their operating cash for their core businesses or something they have 272 billion cashequivalents total

cash cash equivalents and us treasury bills in millions 271835 on page 37httpswwwberkshirehathawaycomqtrly3rdqtr24pdf


if you were looking at their financial statement on yahoo finance or something you need to add and subtract a few different numbers not sure which ones but one i know you have to add is short term investments available for sale 288031000 the short term treasury bonds in thousands aka 288 billion which is buried under total assetsinvestments  why would you invest in an individual pick instead of brk i bought brk and have done well but i would never buy one of his individual picks brk gives you access to brks private businesses  show me a person who overperformed qqq without riding one magical stock 


predicting longterm success of technology companies seems to be impossible   he bought apple at like 11 pe  he or probably ted or todd sold it in the last quarter  the beta is like 86 right now which means its 86 as volatile as sp  this was like 10 years ago im not arguing either way just stating why its brought up hes clearly smarter than me   oh well then shoddy here knows how buffett operates   it wasnt a huge position i have brk and blk in that segment  follow up  not too bullish with news like this  
warren buffett breaks 6year streak doesnt buy back berkshire shares despite 320b cash pile  rwallstreetbetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscomments1gut0uswarren_buffett_breaks_6year_streak_doesnt_buy  all of it  i dont have time to look it up but i have to assume thats the beta of its investment portfolio its also sitting on a quarter trillion in cash which is far less volatile than the sp  beta isnt always in correlation to the sp500 it could be anything else

also how is it 86 i thought they were mostly cash maybe im mistaken  you seriously think buffet would allow one of his generals to buy 50 billion in apple without final approval from buffet  almost  i looked it up reduced 96 of the position  wow im surprised they only held for a few months then took a loss must be for tax loss harvesting purposes but ive never known berkshire to hold for that short of a time frame",0.899,0.9954,1
Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"httpswwwbnnbloombergcabusiness20241117trumpteamsaidtowanttoeaseusrulesforselfdrivingcarshttpswwwbnnbloombergcabusiness20241117trumpteamsaidtowanttoeaseusrulesforselfdrivingcars

  
tsla 5 overnight due to this news

  
bloomberg  members of presidentelect donald trumps transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully selfdriving vehicles one of the transportation departments priorities according to people familiar with the matter

if new rules enable cars without human controls that would directly benefit elon musk the tesla inc chief executive officer and trump megadonor who has become a powerful fixture in the presidentelects inner circle he has bet the future of the ev maker on selfdriving technology and artificial intelligence

current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities which tesla plans to do the trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate selfdriving vehicles according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they werent authorized to speak publicly

while the transportation department through the national highway traffic safety administration can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles an act of congress would clear the way for mass adoption of selfdriving cars a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around avs two of the people said

one candidate under consideration for transportation secretary is emil michael a former uber technologies inc executive who has spoken with trumps team and potential staffers they said the work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined they said 

republican representatives sam graves of missouri and garret graves of louisiana have also been considered to lead the department the people said

the transition team didnt respond to requests for comment

musk in october announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026 current us regulations pose significant hurdles to musks plans for the socalled cybercab including a cap limiting their deployment 

he supported federal rules for autonomy on teslas thirdquarter earnings call saying hed use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide the pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of uber and rival lyft inc

trump has since named musk and entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy to lead a new department of government efficiency initiative to dismantle government bureaucracy and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome

past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled

nhtsa currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2500 selfdriving vehicles per year under a granted exemption but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100000 have repeatedly failed

a bill to do that sailed through the house several years ago during trumps first term but the measure has been bogged down in the senate an attempt during the first year of the biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming classaction cases",obliviousredditor3,2024-11-18 09:52:41,272,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/,,"hi youre on rstocks please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being offtopicpolitical feel free to edit it now and be more specific

to everyone commenting  please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being offtopicpolitical

if youre interested in just politics see our wiki on relevant subredditshttpswwwredditcomrstockswikiindex and post to those reddit communities instead without linking back here thanks

i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorstocks if you have any questions or concerns  how can manufacturers with a straight face say consumers shouldnt be able to sue them

in this case their car drives on its own so they have to be completely on the hook for any damages caused by the car if a car self driving car requires me to be liable or requires my own insurance then it is not a self driving car

it will be fun trying to avoid accidents with these unregulated self driving cars  lol we are just crash test dummies  anything they put on the road should not only be safe under various driving conditions but also needs to be safe from hackers 


rushing to put these out on the road is setting up for a series of dangerous events i honestly think these can be safe in the long run but bypassing safety will sabotage the advancement of this industry  this is what 75 million buys  is this becoming similar to boeing approving its own new type of airplanes of course this in teslas and musk short term interest  if there are no regulatory barriers left what excuse will musk use for missing launch dates  removed  aur 108 pre market

edit now 26  so i guess they are not even going to try to pretend to be independent and no just self serving huh thanks america  robotaxi anyone whats a few dead people among friends   removed  i dont get why people think current rules are what is stopping tesla there are already other manufacturers with self driving cars on the road with the exact same rules  ahhhh is this what leave the world behind was about  expect a lot of insurance fraud  would this be the equivalent of the hospital making you sign a waiver before a risky procedure to cover their ass in case the surgery goes wrong  musk is killing the competition after killing the ev subsidy and now changes the rules to have more of his cars on the street very efficient indeed  hopefully they put these self driving vehicles in alabama  trump team  elon musk your evs can and will fall apart years earlier than ice vehicles and you will like it  my tslt about to rip above 30  might be disagreement but i think full self driving cars will never coexist amongst human driven cars 

i think if full self driving does ever happen it will start out with fully self driving areas and then expand over time as more people buy cars with the tech  i thought rstocks believe tesla fsd is so bad and waymo is the true leader in self driving 

so they should be celebrating this development because waymo can be deployed in all 50 states all at once instead of undergoing 50 different set of rules under each jurisdiction 

but keep complaining because its obvious you do not have first hand experience in fsd 1256 in hw 4 cars  i love my tesla stock euphoric this past week   because elon wants to be able to make tons of money quickly and not be responsible  sued for tons of money when things are rushed and things go wrong and people who are not him or his family die

now if his family dies he will be doing the suing but if other people die he doesnt want to get sued  nah tesla just turns off self driving and blames the driver   or requires my own insurance

this sounds reasonable to me have self driving insurance if you want that option shitty self driving cars would be uninsurable or cost prohibitive to own  people ride in deregulated fsd should ensure their affairs are in order personally i wouldnt take that risk  i disagree  any selfdriving car out there tells you you need to pay attention to the road to take over if necessary and anybody whos actually used it will tell you its not perfect


its just like hondas lane keep assist or the advanced cruise control its a worse version of auto pilot but if i were to get in an accident its my fault  is it the same as the doctor asking family to sign a waiver before performing a risky surgery that they wont sue the doctor if there are problems with the surgery  removed  of course you are a good old meatbag with a wallet that selfdriving future companies are looking forward to is turning more and more dystopian  yes we are but not elon or his family if elon or his family get hurt by evs that arent teslas you know hes gonna sue even if he says evs shouldnt be sued  to be fair they havent really cared in a while

car fatalities are on the way up with pedestrian death being the most impacted in the us who could have predicted that putting more and more bigger and bigger cars on the road would cause that oh yeah physics

maybe next we shall introduce the self driving cars to spice things up again at least it might solve the social security and heath care cost issues if people die young enough  they just care about money  
nothing extra  better than 1 billion  removed  httpsenmwikipediaorgwikirobotaxitextas20of20202320there20has201820e2809320have20not20been20realized

apparently theres only been one in the last 6 years  i mean you kind of answered your own question 

there are current cars that operate fine under exact same rules but tesla cant hack it under the existing rules so they are seeking to lower the standard  it already haswaymo cars are doing 100 000s rides per week  well based on teslas own communication fsd is just assistant driving and waymo is the company with the most drive autonomous miles in the us so its not an opinion but simple facts    thats a terrible idea actually

doing that would mean removing one huge incentive for car makers to improve their selfdriving system and move the liability into the consumer

they are the only one that have the ability to improve their system especially when the technology will be all closed if you remove the liability from the car maker what incentive do they have to improve their system

even worse they could just tell the consumer that their model is not safe enough and they should just by the next model instead of fixing it

if carmakers want to sell self driving cars with no driver they should only do so if its safe and they should be the one paying for insurance  the thing is companies are dropping tesla for insurance because its not worth it


until tesla gets lidar and radar it wont be fully capable of self driving 


you simply cant run what he wants off a camera its technology impossible 


its also why self driving cars and busses in cali are doing so well because they have all three  you cant opt out of being in a collision with one  your name says it all  im sorry for this comment its just terrible how does the size of a car relate anyway to how many accidents there were

what actual evidence do you have that bigger cars or more likely to be in accidents


youre just going on the base assumption that because a car is heavier its more deadly but there is way more nuance than that  how so  removed  consumers will choose cars with cheaper insurance which means improvements will continue  he didnt say accidents he said pedestrian deaths if you cant figure out why a f350 is more likely to kill a pedestrian it hits compared to a civic then you should go back to school  you tell me how spending 1 billion in a presidential loss with 20 mil in debt is somehow better  please explain  removed  better than what  removed  removed",0.7783,-0.9939,1
MCD and SOUN?,"httpscareersmcdonaldscomdirectoraiengineeringjob28631538

mcdonalds is ramping its ai efforts back up and all signs point to soundhound ai as their next major partner their recent job posting for a director of ai engineering focuses on integrating generative ai genai and large language models llms into existing systems rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch this aligns perfectly with soundhounds expertise in conversational ai and their dominance in the foodservice sector notably mcdonalds previously ended its ai collaboration with ibm leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drivethru kiosk and mobile ordering systems

adding fuel to the speculation soundhound recently announced on their earnings call that theyve secured a major new client in the restaurant industryone they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others given mcdonalds history of partnering with established tech leaders like dynamic yield and the timing of this hiring its hard not to connect the dots if this is indeed a mcdonalds x soundhound collaboration it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cuttingedge conversational ai im expecting an announcement in the next month on who the new logo is and i think its pretty likely the largest name in the industry",girldadx4,2024-11-18 20:35:29,19,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gu6rqi/mcd_and_soun/,,"ive only ever seen people on reddit shit on soun which is enough to make it a strong buy for me  i used to think soundhound was just a crappy company that rode the ai wave now i look at their partnerships and theyre with a lot of the big car guys most restaurants with their yum partnership and it seems like theyre seeing success with the restaurantservice industry definitely a stock to look at  the most recent criticism i have seen is that ai is easy and the market will be saturated those are the people using chat gpt and seeing the cool stuff they can do with minimal effort they have no understanding of the level of rd required for reliable hardware integration with consistent results
