"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 15, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks
* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)
* StreetInsider news:
  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips
  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.


See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

Probably still has more upside but I'm not going to get greedy. || There goes that Trump Bump already! 2025 should be very interesting || Down 10% on AMD. || Anyone buying NVO at $102? || Netflix is freezing up on the Tyson fight. Can't be good for the stock Monday morning || Reminds me of July when we had a big drop after an exaggerated exurbance run. I think we go lower for now. || Trump and his band of austerity dipshits are going to completely fuck GDP growth and the economy. It's like a movie on replay at this point. Republicans fuck the economy, then the country elects a Democrat to fix it. Then the country gets tired of growth and votes for a Republican to again fuck us all over again. || It’s hard to take anything in this country seriously anymore with Trump’s clown show picks. 

The market does need strong and trusted institutions. Will it price in the potential risks of this cabinet? || [removed] || Can someone check on the guy who bought $100k+ in itm asts calls expiring in Dec yesterday? Because I don't think that guy is having a good day.  || What a pfun day to own Pfizer yay || TDW is almost below $50 at this point. You will make a killing on LEAPS when oil prices rebound or sell puts 6 months to a year out. Currently you can secure a $12.00 premium at $60 strike for puts expiring in May. That's nuts considering the average true range of the stock: TDW can realistically return to $60 in 3-5 days off good news. However, it's being priced like the company is going bankrupt.

If the S&P fills the gap to the downside, there will be a ton of great stocks at a discount that got disproportionately pummeled by bearish sentiment. || Recommendations for next week:

* **Novartis** - puts, $100 strike, December '24 expiration. Wait until after it breaks the 8-day EMA to the upside.
* **Cigna** - puts, $315 strike, December 6th expiration. After the gap up it was rejected at the 50 and 200 EMA simultaneously. CI is currently sitting at the 8-day EMA. Get in if it breaks and finishes below that point. 
* **Tandem Diabetes** - puts, $29 strike, December '24. Wait for it to finish above the 8-day EMA.
* **Nasdaq Inc.** - calls, $80 strike, December '24.

Niche insurer mainly in New York. A lot of big names are pulling out of the region, leaving a vacuum for them to fill. 

They're also divesting assets in other areas that haven't worked out as well for them.

Another one bites the dust, what rklb did in even small launch very impressive when so many who raised as much or more didn't get anywhere near their outcomes || [deleted] || Sold HSY puts for a 180% gain. || LLY getting pounded || my precious csiq.. || Thoughts on Moderna this cheap? They've had a shit year but are nearly back to early 2020 prices. If they have great vaccines /drugs coming down the pipeline I'd hope it has *some* potential there. || Bid/ask spreads are going haywire in the final few minutes. || anyone looking to get in to LBRT liberty energy since their CEO is the new appointee of the DOE? i'm long on energy anyways. i'm also not saying any funny business will be going on but we're all human. || Sunnova is the next SunPower -> $0

Remember Sunpower $SPWR? They filed for bankruptcy back in mid July. I’m here to tell you why Sunnova is next. 
I’ve worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years. Sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealers/installers all year. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sunnova is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. Search Reddit/facebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and it’s a pretty open secret. 

“NOVA holds approximately $7.98 billion in total debt. This represents a 25.33% increase over the past year, contributing to a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.58, which is significantly above industry norms”

They currently sit at a $485 million market cap, eerily similar to Sunpower before they went under. It is only a matter of time for Sunnova. Most dealers/installers are moving all of their volume away from using them as they’ve been late on payments. Instead of the reps getting paid upon install, they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated. Sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing. The last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new Sunnova PPAs/loans. 

Sunnova holds an INSANE amount of debt. I honestly have no idea how they are still afloat. I didn’t think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year. Their free cash flow is in the toilet.

“Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) reported a negative free cash flow (FCF) of approximately -$2.13 billion over the trailing 12 months. This figure is derived from an operating cash flow of -$282.75 million and capital expenditures totaling -$1.85 billion. The significant cash burn highlights the company’s capital-intensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations”

I know what you’re thinking, their stock is already down massively since the election. Yes, that was based on all solar stocks dropping. Sunrun (which I believe will be around for the long haul) also dropped like a rock. However I believe within 6 months Sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0. 
I don’t think trump will kill the solar tax credit. However it wont matter for Sunnova. Their CEO is a former Enron exec. This company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat. Has worked for far longer than it should have. Their partnership with Home Depot has largely been a dud. Nothing like Sunruns partnership with Costco. 

Unless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1% in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts.

Zoomed out I’m still up 7% for the month and 30% YTD. When and if my portfolio goes lower next week and beyond, will just have to keep reminding myself to zoom out and it’s healthy looking from that POV. || Never been so pleased to be 60% s&p 🙏 || Y red || Its so over || Google never ceases to disappoint me || How cooked are healthcare stocks with RFK Jr at HHS?

Dude, I hate trump as much as the next person, but the US was ONLY GROWING because of insane reckless government spending. If it takes a 6% GDP defecit (or whatever it is) for 3% GDP growth that just means debt to GDP keeps growing and that cannot happen in perpetuity.

The ONLY way out of this is a big recession, or >10% inflation. Somethings gotta give. And the longer it gets kicked down the road, the worse the inevitable recession/inflation will be || Yup, stock market wasn’t up at all before Covid hit when Trump was president! || >The market does need strong and trusted institutions

I wonder whos entire life goal was to undermine them for decades then.

Also the entire premise is off, why does the market needs strong and trusted institutions, it hasn't needed any of that like ever? Also I don't think becoming Europe would bring us investors any sizeable returns || The most likely case is that EoY flows that likely have to happen rescue this market beginning later this month, but all bets are off when we turn the page to 2025. 


My original instincts were right it seems. Gonna have to hold on for dear life seemingly like 2021 (and it may be a case of holding on for 5 months) and it'll be show time next year, probably a mix of 2018/2022. || > trusted institutions.

weird way to spell ""burn it all down."" || There is a lot of inertia in the federal government, and we still have functional, pro business courts. || Is your entire portfolio down as well? || Yep, the stupid is in full force.

I also feel it’s bound to see a correction || [deleted] || To be frank, we're getting dangerously close to it being likely the AI cycle ended in the summer after all, with time of year leading to it being hidden until 2025. 


The semiconductor group should NOT be this weak and it is a huge warning that it is. || I'd avoid for now, semi cycle peaked and we're looking for a higher low somewhere. || in a bull market, better buy high sell higher high performance stock. It's not a time for gambling, catch falling knife, you can't tell the price you catch is the bottom yet. || So you’d prefer to be taxed every year on your index fund dividends at a higher marginal rate (and possibly wash sale activity that could screw over taxed advantaged accounts, depending on how you manage your portfolio) over active trades of individual stocks in your taxable? Plus risking huge losses on individual stocks yet not being able to replenish your retirement account if you make a bad trade. 


I find a taxable brokerage account gives me more control, and can be very tax efficient if you manage trades by lot. You can sell all of the high loss/low gain and long term lots first. || Unless you’re using margin. This is the way!! || Moves like this usually last longer than people expect. Smart thing to do is stay away from it. It will probably keep rolling over shorts for a while yet. || Been doing it since this morning, now it's not fun || My rule of thumb is don't short in a bull market, not worth the risk || timing is the impossible part and any gaurantee of profits is already baked into the option price. || I mean I suppose it's better for execs to actually care about shareholders making money if you own the stock. But seems to confirm that a lot of their valuation is smoke and mirrors at this point. I sold 80% of my stake at $60. Will sell the other 20% at $70. || As if there wasn't enough of a red flag with the CEO making statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"". || Healthy pullback is fine || Markets went down about 9"" || You got me curious || Go back to it and look at your stocks EOD Monday. || and you didn't invite any of us, big dawg? smh || Maybe for the inidices but lots of stocks are sold off hard with good buy opps. || Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. It's fucking insane.

People buy overvalued shit like PLTR and get rewarded by 60% gains in 8 days. This is fucking insane. I can't use the real word to describe this since it's banned on the sub.

This market has gone full simple jack || only the 95th percentile?

Aren't they one of the only companies to make it into orbit? || RemindMe! 2 months || I bought more $TLT this morning.  The current yield is around 3.95%.  US 20 yr interest rates will get below that rate eventually.  The question is when?  And since I can't time the market, I might as well buy the sure thing which is $TLT that will eventually increase in price while collecting a 3.95% yield until US 10-20 yr rates fall below that level. || Is there a chance it goes to the low 80’s again? || I sold all my RKLB at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;( || I sold all at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;( || if you want AI hardware. go nvda or go home. Buy high sell higher.

Might see a quick pump/dump this week but longterm might be good bets. || Super bullish for OKLO, Wright had invested $10M at a very early stage- he’s sold on SMRs and especially their solution, along with Thiel || wouldnt mind it pulling back til January || You need at least a 30% pullback for healthy valuations. || Because someone actually bought the Pokemon Greninja ex 214/167 Pokemon TCG Twilight Masquerade Special Illustration Rare card for $329.99 yesterday on Ebay marking the top of the speculative bubble : ) || The +23% this year isn't good enough? || Nothing a few million dollars in donations won’t solve || I still don’t see how his appointment affects LLY and NVO in any significant way || I’ve been buying the dip on PFE 🤷🏼‍♂️ || If healthcare is going the way of the dinosaur then i guess it's time to sell.  

You can clearly see people freaking out over day to day action. || As someone who invested in them heavily 2019-2023, I'd avoid chip equipment for awhile personally. Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML, and KLAC all seem primed to see declining growth and shortening backlog the next year or two due to the massive global fab build out we've seen now getting into operation. I also expect China sanctions/tariffs to hit them hard. Foundries (TSM, Intel, Samsung, etc) are probably going to be taking a step back from the massive capex orders they've been putting in to recoup their investments for awhile. || Probably going to be pain until next year. A lot of the chip market for autos and industrials have sucked for the past year. 

Hopefully will rebound next year, but pieces for these companies are actually solid for long term holds.  || Powell said yesterday fed isn’t in a rush to reduce rates || December rate cuts went from 83% to 50s.

The writing was on the wall and the short bounce above $3 was one my best stock option exits yet, especially now with hindsight regarding the bankruptcy.

Your options are currently worth 0, some brokers support selling on OTC markets, not sure about fidelity. Also you have to check the status of the stock on OTC, it might be halted due to the bankruptcy for some time. I would say there will be 0 liquidity for your options anyways. You might have to work with Fidelity directly to sell it.

But to be frank, I am not sure how long dated are the options you are holding, but your only way out is if the stars align and someone buys the company along with the debt, otherwise you are wiped out. Rules of the casino. || Expectations are in the gutter for Disney, and sky high for mega-cap tech. It's that simple. || stocks dont move proportionally to fundemetnals changes. 

stocks often stay depressed (or elevated) for long periods, then suddenly something changes and the stocks moves alot

sentiment finally changing for disney. 

look at sofi as an example - improving fundementals for years, stock goes nowhere. suddenly one additional quarter of the same thing and the stock pretty much doubles. 

why didnt it happen the previous quarters? why didnt stock move up slowly as earnings kept beating? why did it stay pretty much flat? || Because it does that.  

Monday it will be up irrationally as well. || Powell's remarks today indicated the Fed may slow down or halt its rate cut schedule. This alone would not have triggered a selloff except the import price index came in very hot and business inventories were smaller than anticipated. Then there were some of Trump's picks for cabinet positions. || Powell said no rate cuts in December. And some trump picks scared the market. He said he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in and imposed tariffs so the tech sector is selling off more than the general market || Borderline crashing.

I bought AMZN and GOOG bigly in December 2021 and ok with that today. Probably won’t feel worse. || I wouldn't. If it's getting delisted odds are they're not in good shape. I understand risk/reward, but the risks there, in my opinion, don't justify the potential rewards. SMCI is interesting, but you don't get one of the big accounting firms to dip on you without some serious issues.

I agree, it's going to be painful in the  short to med term, but long term, these are good prices. || Few things.

Chip makers are moving towards square wafers and there is a lot of gains happening in the advanced packing market. This is more Onto’s space.

Investors are also nervous about, if their acquisition of Catalent will go through. If it gets blocked, it will set Novo Nordisks ability to ramp up their production back significantly. However, they do have a ""plan b"", whatever that might be.. || We don't have a long-term healthy economy. 

During the last two years of Biden's term, the government spent 6-7% of GDP to maintain GDP growth of 2-2.5%. Mind you, governments typically spend 2.5-3% of GDP during recessions as a countercyclical measure. Private sector investment and payrolls have been abysmal during that time, not to mention GO has trailed GDP since 2022. Gross output *front runs* gross domestic product during a recovery. || Trump added 8tr to debt and only 2 tr to GDP. Biden added 8tr to debt, but 8tr to GDP. It's a blowout.

He didn’t add anything other than tax cuts. But a sign of a strong stock market  is how it responds to adversity

Trump let it crash with Covid 

Biden actually had to pass things to make this stock market resilient. And look despite everything happen look at it now || I’m about to lose all the gains from him getting elected || We no giant anymore. Our MC is pathetic. Still holding tho. || I've been pretty critical of LEU as not being worth $100 based on fundamentals, but it's starting to retreat back into sensible territory. If it falls below $60 it's worth looking into. Some of the mid-tier and junior gold miners are getting beaten up due to gold price and the failures of the large caps, yet they're still recording record margins and FCF. WDOFF, GAU, SAND, FSM, etc. are trading cheap atm; AEM is woefully underpriced compared to its blowout earnings report. ANET is oversold IMO. Ditto for biotech and health care. 

My main recommendation is to run puts on individual stocks. The weak ones with strong downward trends are going to get destroyed if the indices continue falling, giving you the opportunity to make a lot of money quickly and recycle that cash into the oversold strong ones. My portfolio is flat today but I'm up 3% overall due to fading HSY. u/Deep_CFC did even better. || 5750 is the 50-day MA, 5700 is the pre-election floor, 5400 is the September 6th floor, and 5180 is the August bottom. Given that election FOMO broke the rising wedge pattern that would've led to a normal correction, there's a real chance we break the 50 EMA and the pre-election floor. || None of them have hit their marks yet. 

The market open doesn't factor in.

NDAQ is still fine to enter. It's a long play with plenty of room to run. || When? About a month ago.

Why? Because short-term option trades are among the safest and most lucrative ways of making money *if* they are exploiting the structural makeup of the stock market. This is the opposite of gambling on directional plays or using them to hedge a larger portfolio. Additionally, it allows consistent cash flow to recycle into the main portfolio.

What informs them? The nature of the strategy. All of them - I use 3 to 4 right now - rely on piggybacking off the money flow in stocks/ETFs in different ways. 

Currently I'm selling off some holdings to allocate 30% of the portfolio to options. It will be a substitute for bonds, whose profit factor pales in comparison and returns don't compound. || Always a massive red flag when the CEO of a public company makes statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"". || What expiration? || Like Instagram and Whatsapp? What are more popular alternatives to those? || Correct. 

SMH has not come close to recapturing its July high despite the market attaining several new ATHs. It's failed to decisively break $260 resistance twice during that timespan, and now it's rolling over. Semis were in the red even during the post-election hype rally. || Depends on the semi exposure. The only line of business for the past year or so that has been good was the advanced compute/ai stuff. 

If you follow the market, auto and industrial names that are more of the dumb chips have not found a bottom and have been seeing sales slump for a while. || Shorting is the ultimate fomo game. I don't think I've ever made money buying puts but I'm always right about overpriced companies in the long term.  || Word || agree, lots under the surface thats plenty cheap || Please name a few good blue chip stocks that have fallen pretty good i see amazon which i can buy. I have some cash sitting on the sidelines || This is Trump's economy now, so the only companies that will do good in the future have a direct hand in his corruption. That is why TSLA and PLTR are up, it's because they will directly benefit from this corruption. || I remember '99. I was there. I lost 30k in the Dot Com bubble bursting. 2000/2001 basically.

This is not the same as that. Because, for every AppLovin or Palantir that we have right now, we had 30 more in 1999. It's only a few stocks here and there that are going nuclear.

If things were really as amazing as people make it out to be, my portfolio would be sky high and it isn't.

Unfortunately, I don't have a Palantir or AppLovin in my lineup. My only stock that's pumped recently has been Palo Alto, but it's pump was incredibly mild compared to some of the highflyers. I have a bunch of stocks that have gone nowhere recently. Google, Broadcom and AMD are three great examples. All wallowing in the mud, for various reasons. Broadcom is up if you zoom out, but I only bought it earlier this year. I didn't get it in 2023, wish I did.

Basically, the point I'm trying to make is that in 1999, the equivalent of Google, AMD and Broadcom would all be going absolutely sky high. Everything was topping. It wasn't just the hardcore internet plays with high potential and zero real-world profits that were going absolutely nuclear..... even the regular stocks were going wild. We don't have that right now. Is Apple $245 right now? Is Microsoft $500 right now? || > Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. 

based on what? || I’m just saying the obvious mate and I’m not complaining about any stock stock falling specifically rn || Because it doesn't trade on fundamentals and has a cult following, It's not a bad company per se, I myself own some shares, but it's just trading on vibes with P/S of 28, higher than that of SpaceX || I will be messaging you in 2 months on [**2025-01-15 16:44:21 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-01-15%2016:44:21%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grtfyq/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_nov/lxaelx7/?context=3)

It's the best space stock IMO . Have revenue, revenue keep growing, the least volatile compare to gsat asts lunr. || I wanted to be greedy, but once it hit $171.50 I figured it was best to take the money and run. 

For someone who just started options trading, you hit the jackpot on this one. Don't feel any regrets about not trying to maximize down to the dollar. || We'll have to wait and see. Won't have the TFSA room for it until January anyways, but I'll keep an eye out. || didnt think about a pump & dump because of this. damn good looking out. || does he have experience in small scale nuclear or has he said something about it? i just know his background is, in part, in fossil fuels and possibly some self-delivering mechanisms whatever they are. || They’ve doomed us all || I’ve meant the P/E ratio being so low lmao. Just because it has went up doesn’t mean it’s not undervalued af || I am looking into LRCX and KLAC. Already have some AMAT and ASML , down some though. Once we commit to holding long term and factor in the demand for power/cost efficient chip and the associated complexity, it should work out great. || Yeah I’m excited to see what the earnings look like once the “dumb chips” inevitably rebounds.

If that rebounds and AI chip demand stays strong, earnings could be insane the next few years || That's bullish cuz it means economy isn't fooking exploding || No interest in CDNS and klac? || That one has been eclipsed by the EU one. || They can't control them, so all they can do is extort them. 

No difference than paying the mob ""protection"" money. || Karp is god your name opinion is invalid pltr to 500/share || Something like 70% of Britain doesn't have AC and for some weird reason, global temps are higher.... || Midstream should enjoy a nice decade ahead, so we're in a good spot to slowly add to our holdings. || There is another user here, i always forget their name, that had a post around equipment maker names. If follow the chip space, outside of advance computer, there has been a ton of weakness in auto and industrial markets. 

A lot of these names have come down in price and are looking like solid longs, but there is still going to be pain until those markets recover. 

With ONTO in particular, they did just report earnings on the 31st and I recently got into them after learning more about them. 

I know a lot of people are kind of hit or miss with youtube, but I would highly suggest watching the video from chip stock investor on ONTO. We can't post youtube links here, but they are hands down one of the best ways to learn about a lot of these companies. They are trying to sell you on their discord/news letter, but overall still gives you great content from the videos. || Not going to lie, I had only been eyeing AMAT, but I saw ONTO in this thread, looked at its stats, and like it at a glance. It seems like it’s on sale in today. I’m part of the Reddit repeat problem. Have no position, but it’s on my radar from this subreddit. || Thanks, Interesting to know. || Great to know, solid growth story. || no idea about ulta moat but they must have something  - look at those margins. Elf is is a marketing machine with high margin beauty product company attached. Not sure how old you are but it is hard, imo, for the over 50 crowd to understand ( and stomach) the way marketing to younger women has to be handled now. Its clear that both L'oreal and Estee Lauder have had a hard time responding the demands of a younger consumer when there was choice. The ""moat"" is its human capital imo. Once the street gets a better handle on elf's ability to grow at a lower growth rate the stock will probably regain its upward trend. It won't grow like in the past but likely has a ton of runway left over the medium and longer term. I have my fingers crossed for a long long long runway of high simgles to low teens growth internally financed but we'll see || [deleted] || I will tell you to all in . Because I hold a lot of MSTR. Finacial advice! || Market has been completely ignoring any geopolitical risk for semiconductors. || My guess for now is that it won't really start being priced in until we flip the calendar to 2025 and it's going to be a huge mess because semiconductors have gotten too far intertwined with the Nasdaq compared to even the recent past.

Gonna have to take down some of my exposure to Broadcom, pop some popcorn, and be ready to pounce when you see SMH lose most of its gains from late 2023. || Buy high sell low the redditor way || If the news is poor, the trading opportunities to the downside will be even greater. || It's interesting how so many people miss that aspect of earnings. It's not uncommon for people to ask why around them and it's usually a few things that impact how people trade earnings, which is like how much the stock ran up, how was last quarters performance, what is the guidance, then any macro news like stock buybacks or leadership changes. 

Plus I want to say you can even look at options to see the implied move to the upside or downside. || >He said he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in

Now we know who to blame the robot uprising on || >he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in

How is this bad for the tech sector? || [deleted] || It's a stock with an incurable disease of insider selling. First bezos, now MacKenzie rumors say. || U think it’s going down even more next week? My plan is to DCA weekly to be safe and then eventually lump sum || Bro.. Thursday - options expiry is a more probable explanation than anything  || Id add that u should buy the one with the lowest expense fee || I like the thesis but who are Onto's main clients? I want to know if theyre mainly selling to TSMC or companies like Intel. || You are correct. I also believe the OP holds $ON || Because companies’ trajectories can always change || Because MRNA is down almost 90% from its pandemic peak. 37 today - you think it will ever reach 450 again? || A lot of individual stocks either stay flat or go negative. Just check out the stocks in the SP500. You need to time it to do well. Look at $MSFT is it extremely flat this year, great company. || Sylvester Stallone trying his best for Dept of Education calling Trump the 2nd George Washington. || The fact is that the unemployment rate is low, consumer spending is still resilient, inflation is calming down, and growth is still good

Could be a lot worse: recession || Biden didn't add ""8 trillion to GDP"". The economy was coming out of COVID so naturally GDP would skyrocket back up. But Biden torched gross output in the process - that's far more important than GDP - which is why so many sectors are in malaise. || Yes its a lot easier to add GDP when trillions of money gets printed || Oh the good old “if the economy does well during a republicans term, it’s because of the predecessor” argument. 

But if the economy does well during a democrats term, it’s because of them, right? Couldn’t be because of Bush that Obama did well, right? || “Let it” crash? As in he could have prevented crashing, yet the economy literally crashed in every other country as well?

Tons of reasons to not like Trump but acting like he’s responsible for the COVID economy crash? Lmao. Would have crashed regardless of which political party was in power || Yeah I’m seeing a huge dip. I ate losses on EL earlier this month. I think I’m just going to ride these out for a while. || Probably not alone.


I'm going to credit CosmicSpiral here. There's clearly no interest in markets right now. 


I was right that the vol unwind was going to push markets higher, but there was no substance behind it outside the vol unwind.


EoY flows may help us hold on for dear life, but I think we may be screwed next year. || Oh no back to values last seen since... Monday! 

Did you just start investing last week or something? || yeah, but there a lot good turnaround stories for legacy industry stalwarts that lost their direction. 

look at GE, 3m. || [deleted] || Would you explain how you can read the steal make up of the stocker market? And how to read the money flows? || Karp is always like that. He’s a weird one lol || can say the same to Micheal Saylor, Elon Musk.
That's how those smart guys do ""marketing"" to their stock.
They build themselves a character on social media. They act edgy. They want you to hate them, so they can be noticed -> they are more popular -> their business get more popular to the public.

Technology good enough, fundamental good enough. you just need someone to marketing the good to the public.

They are closely tied with the University of Maryland (who have a really good physics program). The stock is already up 169% as the smart investors (like me) see that quantum computing will completely flip the tables on traditional CPU/GPU based hardware. 

Just to do some basic calculations: the TAM of quantum computing is going to be about $1T by 2035. IONQ, as the market leader, will probably take at least 40% of this. So call it $400B in sales. Assume they have gross margins rivaling NVDA, say 70%. That's $280B in annual earnings by 2035. Currently IONQ does -52M in profit (as they inflect toward profitability). Assuming they get halfway there by 2030, or $140B in net income. They have 211M shares outstanding, but assume this quadruples for their massive capital expansion. That gets you to $165 in EPS by 2030. Apply a conservative 8x multiple on this and you get a stock price of $1320 in 5 years. That's roughly a 208% CAGR.

Wonder if it hold. || what's stopping me from selling a stock that I know for sure will rise so that I can ensure a certain amount of profit?  Like sell the stock and buy it again immediately || I'm laughing at Google bagholders, how come you guys always say that the biggest trash is undervalued? you guys were shilling Disney, Intel, Paypal, DKING, Square and all of it is down bigly, only PLTR came on top, now Google got kiss of death from Reddit, even monkey would do better with investing than what's upvoted here, makes me think that the stocks that funds want to dump are upvoted by fund's bots because it's almost impossible that bad investment advices are so highly upvoted each time and also the stocks that had huge run were fudded here like RDDT, Tesla, META, HOOD, you guys are amazing. || In the event we do see an ugly semiconductor unwind next year (which continues to look likely with this type of ugly price action) Google is very much going to be a key Nasdaq laggard along with them, probably into July.

Hope that helps. || Oh, if it wasn't clear it's over, over for the next 12ish months for semiconductors, today is really rubbing salt in those wounds.

I'd have much rather NVDA gapped lower. The gap up then tank type move is continued trash price action by all semiconductors.

The interesting thing is that the AI proxies that aren't a semiconductor aren't following. || Who uses google?  I haven't googled anything in ages.  

True, it's more than a search engine but with AI it is a preposterous search engine, looking through ads to find something that is the truth.  

Thats why Ive never owned the thing at its current valuation. || Happy for you.  I hope to be there one day || What are you waiting for to sell? I own my house but if I didnt I would get out…no one knows whats ahead. All we know is you have a down payment. || Does anyone know why they went up 15%? || Uh, have you heard of AI?

AI AI AI AI AI || Just buy stuff with fair multiples only then, thats what I did then that is what I am doing now. If the market tanks your stuff should hold up better than the overpriced stuff and if your wrong and the rally continues you make money as the gap closes or your companies do well. || crypto bubble and AI bubble will make the whole market dump by 50%, the question is when, Berkshire timed it almost perfectly going all in cash, they'll make out like bandits. || just wait when the rates drop again || Yeah, an amazing buying opportunity. That guy who loves T was absolutely salivating over it, claiming it’s going to bring the whole market crashing down for ages. || Your comment makes me panic || Because it's CEO hates profits and allows staff to roleplay activist politicians, maybe? Resulting in major DoJ lawsuit, because they forgot to hedge against trump victory? || Reddit stocks peeps get emotional about their stocks.  I wouldn't use this place to make investment decisions.  I've been buying $TLT under $91.  The employment numbers were't as good as the headlines stated.  

The headline was that jobless claim applications fell by 6,000 to 213,000 for the week of Nov. 16. That’s fewer than the 220,000 analysts forecast.

However the continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, rose by 36,000 to 1.91 million for the week of Nov. 9. That was higher than expected and the most in three years. || You forgot to factor in capital raises. I don't have the patience to write it all out but it turns out we can expect at most a 156% CAGR over 5 years (worst case!). Still decent but meh if you consider how well $MSTR will be doing.

Took a small position (45% of portfolio) today. || There's no way in hell they will make $400B in sales. Are you having a laugh? For reference, Costco makes around $250B in revenue. Quantum computing is a joke. 

So far, the company loses more money with each passing year and the share count keeps increasing. Total shitco and a great short. || That wasn't back of the envelope. That was more like something written on the walls of a crack den || Dang! Nice find bro. Wish I saw this chart a couple of months ago. || Is that the opposite of being priced in || $20B was being thrown around, at that price it seems pretty dumb because a buyer would likely be another big tech player right? || Matt gaetz will drop the case || If they push for the trial to occur in December, I strongly suspect that the prosecutors win considering that we've gotten this far.  || Bottom is in

Time to re-enter with max leverage || It's a phenomenal short. || Yup. Just heard people talking about bitcoin on a flight. Sold my remaining in the air. 98-100k is max for a little while I would think. 

Remindme! 1 month || it's about 40x FCF. Some stocks are even higher than that...cough..nvda.. || Assigning a multiple on par with the Mexican airports would bump up CAAP to a $30 stock. 

Also, I like that they are more focused on redeployment of capital into the business than paying out dividends. They're in a decent position to scoop up properties if governments try to sell off some assets to raise cash. || 7% dividend for OMAB, am I seeing that right? || \-40% in two days, idk bro. But I agree, issuing convertibles while bitcoin rises and your stock goes up to buy even more is not a sustainable idea || Congrats on rcat, that was a very nice trade || Rcat has long term potential, I would maintain a position if you can. Russia is ramping up the war, Europe is going to need weapons. Rcat comes highly recommended by the US. || Momentum swings both ways When something is up like 100% in a month, it can go down pretty quick too. || Whoa || I still don't know what they do. Guess I'll just stay poor || I have coworkers seriously telling others to invest their life savings in it. || just another GME now || Have you heard why? I’m curious since it had a nice pump today. || You know what I never but any individual tech stocks but this is too good a chance to pass up for a swing trade. || Don’t you wish that evil on me Ricky Bobby! || You buy in yet? || Are they making any headway in the online space with BetMGM? || Still considerable downside risk imo. It still has a high valuation and a lot of room to fall even more, if any more concerns about growth emerge... but they could make a comeback if things play out for them. || Not really a semi company, but start looking actually into $CART the other day to open a position. The valuation actually isn't too terrible and it looks to have sold off from earnings since guidance was a little light. || The government gets what the government wants.

Plenty of public servants will be buying Google today knowing damn well they are not breaking up shit, and people will panic.

They bitch about the president divesting himself of any investments but it should be mandatory for every federally elected official to be divested of any investment anything. || Rad. Long on them, wish I bought them earlier. || I don't own them, but been really happy with my KKR holdings. || I bought in last week finally. They're basically Canadas Berkshire Hathaway || Investors think fake bots for election are real || The current administration isn’t serious about reducing inflation.  || Been cycling in and out of Goog and selling CCs on them for like a year now. Keep getting called away (last time at 175) but looking tempting again... || Guess it was speculation so far and now the DOJ said they're really going for it. || What’s the play here? Also isn’t this not confirmed yet so what would happen in the case there is no buyout? || I love it when you can snipe a nice entry with a limit order || I bought 200 shares last week and going to just hold.  If NVDA has a position it is probably good bet. || Now up 11% from POWL and 7% from FN, just buying yesterdays dip. Great swing trades so far. || Good job, let me know abt the next one hehehe || Which is funny because Apples walled garden seems like what the DOJ is trying to break up Google over. Apple has Safari, their own app store and we're controlling green bubble chats for years. || Meta is up 60%+ YTD || Just checked. Up 22% after hours. 94-115 || Corruption is extremely profitable. That’s why it exists. || Redditors should buy Tesla instead of Google, now they're seething. || never sell winner in a bull market, unless you found a faster winner. Nasdaq 100 inclusion + bull market . What can stop APP? will move like PLTR the last quarter || I'll continue to hold this one. Will add on weakness. || While I have no knowledge regarding ELF, I do know for a fact that Carson Block is a lying, manipulative piece of human-like flotsam.  He would issue a short report on his own Mother's retirement fund, if he thought he could make a buck lying about it. || Really shouldn’t be purchasing individual stocks if you need someone on Reddit to give you hope about a holding you’ve had for 3-6 months || Not your fault, got it.  

Everyone has taken profits and are elsewhere.  

Hope the view improves, I reckon it won't for a while. || When you go all in || NVDA, the general of the generals just reported double beat and raise with strong management comments on demand outpacing supply for the foreseeable future. Why would the market suddenly drop on that? || Never || Why would it? I get that on one hand it looks like it ran massively the past couple of months, but on the other hand it's at about 9% CAGR the past 3 years, which is below the 10 and 20 year average || Considering that my top positions (ASML, MSFT) aren’t doing too well, I hope not anytime soon || Just buy stuff that won't drop || This or next month, we're already seeing MSTR cracking, with this AI bubble and MSTR I can see many tech going on 50% off firesales. || “Doesn’t say anything dumb”

Oh you sweet summer child. || The demand is here, but what about the end product? || I posted a separate comment but I just went through the transcript as well. Seems the biggest concern is the decrease in gross margin. Thoughts on that? Are their numbers just too good to keep going up and justify further stock appreciation? || Hindsight is a wonderful yet terrible thing. || Why? || csgp || lol, I saw that too... ATKR had a lot of value investors jumping in 30% ago ignoring what had mooned their eps entirely || This isn’t advice but I’ve sometimes found that if it’s a good enough spike to post, it’s good enough to sell || Perhaps, but sentiment was really poor. Valuation was and is pricey even now, but if sentiment turns it could run still. || Maybe, but not necessarily.  

Whether we even call it a jump depends on the zoom level context.  

One could say it’s more like a regression/bounce from being down so much already, so there’s no downward regression necessary.

I’ve heard speculation it’s a short squeeze, which hints at certain possibilities. || For my PSTG sake I hope NTAP does well too || Stoked for you. Was thinking of playing their earnings, but ended up doing that swing trade with POWL and FN yesterday. || World's shittiest blue chip stock strikes again. || we're up... || To me, this is a great area of ROI for AI. That's the thing, as someone who is a software engineer, people kind of lump AI into one thing. Right now there is two aspects of it, Large Language Models (LLM) and Machine Learning (ML). 

I think in general, ML's seem like much better areas of ROI. Like ML use models and get and interpret data for users. You don't really get to interact with the data like a LLM, but you still get something to take action on. The best example is Google DeepMind, which figured out protein folding. 

ML's will benefit from all the AI spend, I'm still kind of hesitant on the total ROI that LLM's will come to represent, at least in the short to mid term. I still think of them more of proactivity tools and some areas like customer service and paralegal will probably get hit hardest from them at some point in the future. || It ran nicely after its great ER last month

And today it broke a double top at 14.44 so it can continue to the next leg up, around 16.5 in my opinion. || Nah, it can't without making an instant V. Will surely hit new ATH again. || Ended up pulling the trigger on cart this morning. 

NET has had a solid recovery since their earnings as well. || AXP will be more limited in their loaning as they are a bank and CC company, but on the other hand they tend to have more high quality customers.

V will be impacted only through lower transaction volumes. I don't know if transaction volumes will fall by a lot though. You could look at europe where most countries have a 10-12% credit card interest cap. || the concern w nvda isnt the margin, isnt the guidance next q, the concern is do these chips have profitable applications in the next 2-4 years? commoditized chatbots do not seem to be that. || CFO seemed to suggest it was temporary as they ramp up, but it is possible that TSM or someone else could be squeezing them a little I think || Not allowed until it is || A poorly run company, overly dependent on commodity prices ? 🤷‍♂️ || I opened a small position at about 3 just as an outside AI combined with auto recovery bet. Earnings released today which is the reason for the bump, it was incredibly beaten down, a gamble but possible turnaround story. || I looked into it at one point. The company seems to be poorly run, constantly changing out management.

I'm not sure why it spiked, there's some interesting property there...I was just turned off by management. || if uber doesnt control the core technology of AVs then theyll always be the low margin junior partner to whoever does. Waymo has demonstrated that expensive robocars with some remote operation is a viable technology at this point even in a crazy city like SF, but is still more expensive than just having a driver. if Tesla can do what waymo does for cheap then it can win the race. || Why do people think Uber will be out of business?  I actually think Uber will prosper with autonomous cars.  Uber can still be the app for people to book rides and Uber can buy and operate all of the vehicles without having to pay the drivers. || Tune for Brad Gerstner starring in “Young Ackman” on CBS Thursday nights || Your post or comment has been removed due to breaking /r/stocks rule #2 (no spam or self promotion).

The one thing about BN is that they have so many different businesses that it’s a bit tough to understand them as a shareholder || remember any time you dont understand something online these days you can always just bring up bots in some way shape or form || Would like to know too || Maybe they shouldn't have gotten into politics so heavily. Serves them right. Lose elections & fuck your stockholders. || Personally, I would recommend July 2025 calls at $22 strike.

If it was confirmed, there would be no point in an options play as it would be priced in. It is an asymmetric play with 6x upside where the theta decay curve allows you to exit early with a small loss. || Very nice! POWL looked fine to me, suppose it was trigger happy sellers with lots of paper gains || ONTO, MPWR, CROX and MGM, at least thats what I am buying rn || never has it been so easy for retail investors to profit off of corruption || This isn’t a casino???? || Because it’s growth rate is decelerating and it was already priced for perfection || Nukes, inflation and unemployment, it's a house of cards. || Overvaluation, tariffs, debt, looming recession, looming global conflict… Should I continue? || Haha, soo truu.. || Meta/Google/Applovin are the best scaled examples of using gpus for better ads, everyone wants the sexy chat llm killer use case or something but good old ML models to make systems better is a lot of it still || Looking at the earnings reports for the past year they’re showing sustained steady growth despite economic challenges. They’re very close to profitability and in the next year I could see it get into the s&p 500. || Looks optically cheap at 6x TTM EPS, but that becomes 11x the low end of FY guidance (which is still pretty cheap). Not sure what the forward multiple is using mid-cycle pricing for their industry. || If I sold META when it spiked 35% when I bought it at $110 I would have missed out on a lot of gains. || A dull 6 months for PSTG, hopefully a breakout after earnings || Cheers 🍻 

Looks like those worked out pretty decent for you. Why’d you decide they were good options for swing trades? Thought the reactions to earnings were overblown? || Hell of a lot more green on that big board now, for sure. || There are many non-glamorous sectors where machine learning is going to dramatically boost efficiency, cut costs, and shorten timelines. Everyone's focused on tech for the headline breakthroughs but biotech, mining, oil & gas drilling, payment processors, etc. can enjoy considerable gains without the advent of AGI. The pattern recognition and data processing abilities alone will be transformative. || I have not looked at maplebear since it's ipo, will have to check again || Cart as in instacart? What made you interested in them? || That's more long term yes but as long as Meta, Amazon, etc. keep spending then NVDA will get their bag. || Medical and security applications for AI are all but untapped. Both fields require intelligent search models. Education is another good field for this, and of course coding has used AI for a few years now. || > the concern is do these chips have profitable applications in the next 2-4 years?

I mock techno hype, including the romance of the day with AI.

But here’s the thing... you and I might question it.  But you know who has no doubt and is gambling their companies on it?  Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.  Players who don’t take capex spending decisions lightly.  Players who absolutely have direct knowledge of how their AI investment is or isn’t working.  And with the data they’re seeing, they are fighting like madmen to get every Nvidia chip they can.

I don’t usually appeal to tautology, but I can’t believe they’d be spending so overwhelmingly and rushing to stake claims so rapidly if they weren’t seeing real evidence of actual ROIC already.  

I also think of Jensen Huang, who hasn’t lied yet, and he’s touting claims like “$5 in savings for every $1 spent”.  That’s miracle mother’s milk for corporations.  

Yes, there will no doubt be overshooting.  There always is.  But it seems like early innings as these players are all absolutely rabid for every last chip and every square foot of AI real estate.  Talk may be cheap, but these companies are spending as much as they have, and they’d spend much more if there were more chips to buy. || Actually MSFT if pushing their ai agents hard. I think job automation is what they are seeking. How many call center employees can you replace? The provider of the agent would make bank if they took even like half of payroll costs saved, let alone whatever price they negotiate. And that's just one use case. There's so many || There was a DD made by an analyst that it is more likely Telsa, Google, etc partner with Uber since it would be a way to bring the cost down and maximize utilization. 

This seems like something we wont know the answer to for at least 1 year. || I think between a choice of Tesla, Google, and Uber. The odd one out is Uber. In order for Uber to do well those two dont control the market and that isnt really a popular thing to say at the moment. || Okay, thanks. I'll sell them all tomorrow and simplify it. || My point is that people are chasing the stocks that are already flying. Same with the BTC surge, TSLA, NVDA, PLTR, MSTR and many others. These valuations are not normal, but the market keeps pumping || Very true but they cooked the books and may be delisted. People are hoping for easy money. It's up 67% past 5 days || Many of those are good stocks but you waited way too long to get in || you don't buy stocks like bti, costco, ko in hopes of outperforming with those. they're for adding downward protecting to your portfolio. || Thank you so much i appreciate it  || As always, ""compared to what"".

Point of reference matters. || Thank you, I've always had mentality that I need at least 10k to buy stocks like that || It's been consolidating for 5 years. || Uh it's crashing || It's got cancer like google || I have an MBA and focused on operations and accounting.

High Cash flows even with high AR. It just smells funky. || Not in this market || The term bagholder has lost all meaning || I disagree. Not nice. || It's price action since July.


The industry will be perfectly fine, but the stock prices will remain dead for the time being. || And I wrote that.  Obviously it appears that you didn't read it.

Google serach engine has declined and the outlook is not good.  People are banking on their new model to changing it around.

Thats why its lagged, lets look forward. || Research ebita, earnings reports, growth rates and it spits it out right in front of you.  

Whatever google transforms itself into it will, and it must.  Even they know it but they aren't talking nor should they.  IF you're long, you're long.  Im not buying it yet.  Mid caps are screaming right now. || You do whats best for you. Owning a home isnt guaranteed nowadays. 

Think about it. Everyone rents everything. Subscription based everything. You think homes will get cheaper relative to income? Maybe baring something catastrophic. 

Being an owner will be rare || Yea, thats some rough times in there for sure and only in hindsight is great value easy to see. In terms of good value: MGM, CROX, SIMO, XFAB, Infineon, and EVVTY all fit the bill imo || This is why cheap stocks are cheap. Instead of JPM you got C, instead of NVDA you got INTC. Instead of life changing gains you got soul crushing underperformance. || They can easily dump that much money spreading it into MAG7, since there are other decisive people outside Warren then I doubt it was the last time that Berkshire owns one of the MAG7, they'll buy again some of these giants when the time is right. || Haha, missed the obvious sarcasm. || sir, this is r/stocks, there is no room for humour here || That's like a PhD in quantum comp || Disagree considering that Trump has suggested that he'd let the case die.


I suspect they push strongly for a decision next month considering what I've seen. || Remarkable that biden's DoJ didn't kill the lawsuit, considering google did some heavy duty shilling for dems. They truly are the circular firing squad, lol.

But I'm not too amused because I do own some goog stock... || With companies like this, it's elevator's up and down. Like something going up 100% in a month isn't really sustainable. Not saying the gains won't always last, but I've seen enough names sell off a lot those gains in a short period too. || Man it has been SO bad lately. Definitely normies that never used to talk about investing. I hear bitcoin, mstr and tesla mentioned daily now. I had an older gentleman the other day proclaim he was going to be changing his investment strategy soon to day trading. A coworker next to me spent half the shift watching youtube videos on which shit coin to invest in next. || Well, 10 bucks is more than just profits taking. || That's great news, because that feels like something that leads to only a very temporary dip || Lol, perhaps you didn't look past that first sentence.

There are plenty of public servants out there today buying up shares because they know that they aren't breaking up shit.

The government exists to serve itself, and I would love to see the number of congressmen and senators buying up social media stocks today.

This isn't even a partisan issue, Democrats and Republicans use their position within the government to enrich themselves.

That will never change, and this means nothing in the long term.

That all being said, it's far more enjoyable being a shareholder on green days as opposed to red. || A big chunk of owning Brookfield is trusting Bruce Flatt to keep running it as he has. 

Sort of like buying Berkshire. You don't need to understand everything, just trust in Warren Buffett. || Yeah, just assumed they might be private equity, which is like KRR. Part of why KKR exploded is they bought an annuity business. The key to that is that it supplies with a lot of cash, which they can then go buy more companies. 

Yeah these type of companies could be really hard to understand what is happening under the hood, since there is so many different business and what not. || I get the feeling of being skeptical but what happened on reddit on election month is beyond scrutiny. Call it bots or shills or alt accounts or whatever you want. || Is there anything you are waiting for her in terms of indicators or have you already entered your position? || Wasn't expecting it bounce back so quickly, but the sell off felt way over done. Plus it broke the general trend of how the stock has traded, at least from following. Figured it was set up for some recovery, wasn't expecting it as quickly as like 1 day. 

I mean even ATKR announced this morning and went from being down like 9% to up being up 3.5% now, that's like a 13% gain if you bought this morning, which is wild. Crazy to see some of the reversals in some names. || Whats your thesis for mpwr over the other lagging semis? || Growth rate deaccelerating as it gets bigger and comes into harder comps was expected, hence the guidance raise being a raise, not a cut. Priced for perfection is debatable here || Growth rate slowing down for big companies means their competitors have time to catch up. || Inflation is down, unemployment is still low, and if nukes launch money is the least of our problems || Looming global conflict unlike the last few years with total peace... oh wait a minute || Who's to say it's overvalued?  
  
We don't have many tariffs currently and we don't know what the extent of the tariffs will be.  
  
We are always on the verge of a debt crisis.  
  
What looming recession? The economy is growing and has remained resilient. || looking at finchat ,pre-covid it was about 8fwd, although it cycled between like 5-13 as a range for forwards || Totally agree.  My discipline is to almost always lock in large, rapid gains.  Some times when I haven’t, that peak is gone for years, or forever.  

In this specific case I considered that it’s WBD, which I have less confidence in than Facebook (which, like you, I didn’t sell back then either.) || Yea, bought a little more recently valuation is not as forgiving as it was a while back here though so need some nice numbers to move || I'm long both companies, so I follow them and earnings. 

POWL basically for the past year pops on earnings and then trades flat or down until the next report. This time, it was trading up going into earnings and the reaction to the numbers were over blown. 

Also, this past quarter, I've seen a lot of names drop down and come back with really quick reversals throughout the day. Like LSCC, they were down like 15% in the AH's and then ended green for that day. 

NET recovered a ton from their lows after earnings.

Same thing happened with ATKR today. 

Just seems like the market is somewhat forgiving this quarter, could just be the general bull market happening. 

FN was just way over blown for the news. It was downgraded by around this: 

>B. Riley's analysts anticipate that Fabrinet's business will soon see headwinds stemming from weakening traction for product bundles sold in conjunction with **Nvidia**'s graphics processing units (GPUs). The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's GPUs have been in very high demand, and tech components from third parties including Fabrinet have also been bundled with the advanced processors.

>But **Amazon** is now moving to purchase only Nvidia's GPUs and source additional components in-house or through other partners. B. Riley's analysts expect that other cloud hyperscalers, including **Microsoft** and **Meta Platforms**, will adopt a similar strategy.

So basically an analyst said something might happen in the future based off not much information and the stock went down like 15%. 

Something like that happened a year or so ago with ANET. I've been long on them for awhile and one their earnings call, they said a big customer might, might be key word here, cut back some capex. The stock had amazing earnings and good guidance and still dropped like 15% that day because of that bit of news. 

MSFT dropped one day like 5% because of an issue with FX trading. 

I find that this is one of the benefits of activity paying attention to the market, you can find quick deals. || I think it's also going to get gains from all the investment in LLM's. I think in terms of just pure ROI, ML is much better than LM's and has a lot more use cases. 

Like LLM's are cool, but ML is where the money is at. It's been like that for a while too, in terms of companies using ML. || Same. It's normally something I wouldn't buy, but kind of gives me a little bit of PSTG vibes, in the sense, they are cash flow positive now and growing.

I think they are doing well with advertising right now and growing partnerships. 

Plus they are buying back stock already within like a year of going IPO. It's actually way more of an interesting company going back and looking again. || Normally not a company I would be, but popped up when researching. Valuation is actually pretty solid for the company at this point. 

Plus they seem to be growing more in both advertising and partnerships. 

Their earnings letter to investors is a pretty solid read: 

[https://investors.instacart.com/static-files/45c59490-b81c-4401-ba22-be639847baa7](https://investors.instacart.com/static-files/45c59490-b81c-4401-ba22-be639847baa7) || Some of them like Google are convinced they're closed to creating the digital super god which is infinitely valuable and are willing to pay any price. If this digital super god doesn't happen soon though who knows what happens w the capex || Hey I'm on team nvda. I agree there's uses. || It’s a good starting point. Once/ if you get more accustomed to the market you can find individual stocks you like that you think will outperform the general market. || NVDA just reported double beat and raise and is much more ""the market"", PLTR, TSLA, MSTR, and BTC are all speculative and the people in them generally know that I would think || I can't change the past. I started as soon as I had disposable income. || Costco I don't own anymore. KO I bought for that reason, downward protection, especially since people talk nonstop about the next crash. Bti similar, although I do believe in the bull case for it. Plus I wanted to test the waters with a nice dividend. Between the dividend and it's growth I'm actually pretty happy with it, especially since the catalyst for the big growth I'm expecting hasn't popped up yet || I disagree.  It was a story stock and rightfully fell from that ridiculous valuation with no earnings at all really.  When it dumped they grew into themselves and here we are today.

Don't expect it to fly anytime soon.  Or maybe it will.  I don't anticipate that it will, however, it's a great company and I can tell you it is managed extremely well and the outlook for it is really stunning.

Hang on. || 3 percent?  Yes it dropped below 200, bouncing in its range.  

Its consolidating. || So it is just vibes?  You don't have suspicious numbers to compare to other companies or to Enron, it just looks bad? || When exactly did they fall significantly short of AR expectations in the past? || Not in any market really || I still don’t understand the logic. What about the price action since July means they’ll do poorly for the next 12 months? || TIL setting a new ATH = dead. || No you wrote ""who uses Google?"" As if perplexed by its use cases so he answered. You didn't make it clear that you knew it was still highly popular and in use || Ya ya invest in whatever is good for you, your question was super sensationalist “Who used google” , most dont seem to notice what the AI bros are cribbing about. || I read past it, just thought you were expressing two separate thoughts. || Bruce is probably the best ceo in Canada at the moment || Very valid point. || perhaps but regardless i dont think that can be traced as the reason the stock is up at much as it is *today* (or in general imo, but particularly today) || No. It can be taken up at any point. I just have a lot of spinning plates, and this is one potential play. || ATKR numbers looked pretty rough, so I think you are right market is not in a super punishing mood atm || MPWR was an ai darling due to their relationship with nvda until recently when rumors came out that nvda was alloting more to infineon/renesas. Since then mpwr is -40%ish, but those rumors were never corroborated and the company denied there be an issue. So mostly that mpwr is much more ai exposed vs the other power semi laggards || Nukes don't mean the whole planet will be destroyed, only Ukraine and the surroundings. || The P/E is in the 95th percentile, the tariffs that mango is going to implement will wreck the economy || I guess it comes to sentiment. WBD is not liked so you obviously feel it will tank. I am going to hold. This seems like an inflection point for the company as opposed to peak. || Thanks for the explanation, I haven’t really tried swing trading like that too much, but it’s a nice insight on a method of spotting good opportunities. A skill to be able to spot those things though I think, very nicely done to identify overreactions like that. Do you tend to stick with just trading shares rather than options? || Thanks ill take a look. Yeah i had to do a double take when i read that, not your usual type of suggestions. || Nobody is saying that.  If you listen to them or read their calls, they’re seeing efficiencies and major cost reductions. || Im saying that commoditized chat bots are going to be one of the big ones coming up. Just because it isn't a huge profit jump right now, doesn't mean there won't be stable and impressive growth in the near future. As work on each use case continues, the viability of ai replacement of human work in each case will increase. Tech improves over time. Dont give up on chat bots. openAI is working on a model that can make decisions on a human level, if I remember my headlines correctly. Making decisive and actionable decisions is a huge step forward and something desperately needed before we can say we can fully replace a human in their job || I agree that NVDA isn't *as* speculative, but it's often mentioned in the same sentence as the others. Look at r/wallstreetbets for example. It's just picking any one of those stocks and hyping it up like they're gonna be millionaires. Even on this sub, we have many people asking if now's a good time to buy NVDA, TSLA, etc if they're new to investing and hope to double their money by eoy. 

I'd also say that these tickers are big enough to also contribute to ""the market."" Nvda tsla and BTC are in the trillions and the others are some of the most discussed stocks on social media || Just hodl || Find me another large company with their AR to Rev ratio anywhere this high? You won't be able to || Sensationalist or not, the real thing is you're just sour as it's not growing.  It has nothing to do with me, the market is the market and what I write is how many feel and the market is backing much negative sentiment up.

Until there is a catalyst it will probably sit there.  You aren't going to lose money just be patient.  Or sell it or whatever. || I get that. 

I am getting sick of hearing about anti trust cases by our own government and extortion rackets out of Europe.

They wanna sue someone?

Sue Microsoft for continuing to harass me about Edge and Bing, I want to use Chrome damnit, lol.

Being popular shouldn't be a crime. || I can't vote against Mark Leonard. Sorry. Plus, bonus points for the best CEO beard. || Haven’t they been trying to go private for so many years? For a play like this don’t you basically get the benefit of both the company likley performing well long term and potentially the spike from announcing a buyout? So there’s a situation where even if the buyout doesn’t happen you can also make some good profit. Seems too good to be true lol. || Interesting thank you, might sell a bit more of my amat to diversify there || You don't know that. Nobody knows that. || Yes that’s a fair assessment. I have a lot less confidence in WBD today than I did in $100 META.  Maybe WBD will ramp and for your sake I hope it does || For me, I work from home and have access to the internet and my portfolio all day, so it does make things easier. 

There's way better ways to swing trade tbh. Usually you are going to want to do TA with it.

I do some TA here and there, but mainly just try to find opportunities to trade. Honestly been finding a lot of success with the market overractions. I like to play earnings, but that is extremely dumb and basically gambling lol. Just earnings can be a really big catalyst to move the stock price.

I don't really ever do options, have thought about doing it possible next year. Need to actually learn more about them, since I just never touch them. 

Also keep in mind, all these moves are going to be very risky. I've been taking way more risk recently because I opened up a new account with 500 to see how far I can take. || 100% however the company is more interesting than I thought. I thought of more of just a delivery company, but they actually do a lot more than just delivery. || TSLA Ill give you since its large and mag7, but BTC is the crypto market which I dont feel like is correlates 1-1 with US equities. || You're the one making the accusation why would we do the research to prove your point? You can provide it if you like, until then people will take what u say with a grain of salt || >Find me another large company with their AR to Rev ratio anywhere this high?

So numbers that you can't provide for some reason? || I think they been saying that about tsla for years || I wouldn't say it's a no-brainer: JWN has been flat since May. The key behind this options play is the limited risk with high potential upside. A low beta stock that's primed to get taken over gives you clear risk parameters. || If the rumor is true could be more downside, but at this level could also be somewhat priced in, but if the rumor isnt true you are getting a good deal here is my thinking || Oh yes we know that, it’s simple economics, tariffs are terrible for the consumer, hence the spike in inflation || I do some options trading pretty much purely on price action, generally going for ones that I think are oversold and look like they might be breaking out. I’ve lost a lot of bets but overall I’ve done quite well so far, still a lot to learn. I think I’ll carry on with that as my main guide but I do find it interesting when stocks tank after earnings and then reverse, or the opposite. Identifying why that happens is pretty valuable to increase opportunities. 

But yeah I’d definitely recommend having a look into options if you have a good track record with the short term trading, or even stock picking in general, as it can amplify your wins. For example the POWL 20 Dec 400 strike call is 120% up from the close yesterday. If you’re trading short term and not planning to sit on it until expiry you can find one far enough out of the money that’s a price you’re comfortable with. Options can get a bad rep because people can get carried away, and maybe you will too occasionally unless you’re very disciplined, but I’m very happy I discovered them. The hardest part for me is knowing when to sell, when you’re dealing with such sudden price swings it can be a bit overwhelming sometimes. || BTC has extreme correlation with the Nasdaq - both are tied to global liquidity. || At some point the accusations will be proven correct I'll just wait. These things IF TRUE always appear once the slowdown starts || If you think tariffs caused that inflation spike in 2022, you are misguided. Also, what is good for the consumer isn't the same as what it is good for the stock market. || I didnt say they were not I said not 1-1 - ""the long-running correlation between bitcoin and NDX is 0.805"" || It isn't outside the realm of possibility that Nvidia could fail, but even if it did, your comments and responses are drama baiting drivel slop. || That's a significant correlation still || No they are not they are legit concerns. 

And I'm not saying they will fail, I'm saying they are possibly overstating revenues by a bit to mask growth slowing more than they let on || True"
DOJ calls for Google to divest Chrome in antitrust push,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is pushing for [significant changes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-doj-wants-to-break-up-google-it-needs-to-convince-a-judge-first-090007934.html) to Google ([GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/), [GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/)), including a divestment of its Chrome browser, following an August court ruling that found the company had illegally monopolized the search market.

Yahoo Finance’s Senior Legal Reporter [Alexis Keenan](https://www.yahoo.com/author/alexis-keenan/) joins Morning Brief Co-hosts [Brad Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/) and [Seana Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/) to discuss what this means for Google and its parent company, Alphabet.  
  
Keenan notes that while Google has opposed the DOJ’s proposals, calling them a “radical agenda” that could harm consumers and the tech industry, the case becomes more complicated with the upcoming administration change.

In my opinion, GOOGL shares are extremely undervalued, and this situation will resolve itself once Trump takes control. My advice: buy!",Former_Drawer6732,2024-11-21 21:24:05,403,235,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwii2b/doj_calls_for_google_to_divest_chrome_in/,None,"Why is the stock down today given the news was leaked on Tuesday and the report was available yesterday? || Wonder how this will even play out if the current DoJ will be replaced in two months anyways. || People working at the DOJ: ⌨️ 🦖 || i bought more, it’s heavily undervalued. just DCAing || Ok so in other words it's early Black Friday || What a dumb remedy—it's not even a remedy. Chromium is the source of both Chrome and Edge. It is an open-source product. This will change nothing. It also shows that the DOJ is clueless in this matter. || If Alphabet were split into separate companies—YouTube, Search, Waymo, Healthcare, etc.—the combined value would likely exceed its current valuation. Google is trading at a P/E ratio of 21, with a forward P/E of 16-17, which is remarkably low, especially when you compare it to Tesla, valued at $1 trillion despite generating just $10 billion in revenue. || Can someone explain why Search is a monopoly, as opposed to just a popular product? There are alternatives out there, but most people choose to use search because it's widely regarded as better. Also, Microsoft have railroaded me to use bing more than Google ever have search. || If the DoJ is about fairness and equality they should also force Microsoft to sell Edge and Apple to sell Safari. Also if Google isn't allowed to be the default search engine then do the same for all Browsers, pop up a choice of search engines to select from or let the user decide on something else if it's not listed. || This is just the Biden administration bringing out all the existing cases to public, so that the next Trump administration have a harder time closing them. They want to put it in public before the heads of prosecution teams are kicked out.  
Just lots of showmanship.

I expect more DOJ activity in coming days. || If this was the only bad news around Google, would people sell?

I mean, if Google announces it stops supporting Chrome would this really hurt their business more than the layoffs would save?

From my perspective, the browser business used to be an unprofitable way to lure people into the Google ecosystem, but now for Google it’s nothing more than an expensive hedge.

As a web developer, Google to me has always been a pioneer and advocate for an open web and web technologies, even as more and more people shy away from the browser. The way I see it, if they’re forced to exit this market, it’ll simply hurt this market, not them. || So DOJ is done with going after T-rump, and now decide to pick on Google, just great. || These viscid lawyers should be forced to use Bing everyday for the rest of their life || I thought that the DOJ would just make Google stop paying Apple to be the default search engine and have them pay a fine. Instead they want them to completely divest from Chrome which is definitely interesting. || Yes!! Bought It yesterday! Now it’s done 6 percent! || Get the hell out of my stock DOJ || Can someone please help me understand the impact of this divestment? It does not sound like a big deal at all. || Is this doj even gonna be around in a month || Buy the dip || Google chrome should be worth about $100billion. DOJ undercutting Google seems like a serious breach of law and overreach. Hopefully we get a new DOJ soon. || Is this Venezuela or Cuba? || Same story as usual, retail panic sell on garbage clickbait news. Will be back to 170s in next days if not even in after hours. || What a weird remedy. What would that even accomplish? || Divest deez nuts 🖕 || Chrome is worth at least $100b, who can afford to buy chrome without becoming a target of anti trust regulators anyway? There's a shortlist of companies that can afford chrome and for whom the acquisition makes strategic business sense... AMZN/MSFT/META maybe one other I can't think of || Does anyone know what happens to options in the event of Google breakup? Do option holders get new calls? For those that have been around longer, how long would such a breakup even take? || Would actually make a lot of sense for Wikipedia to scoop it up || It’s not that big a deal for Google, but the DOJ will likely lose. || What happens to google share if Chrome gets seperated from google? Do share holders get share of Chrome or what? || So wait further for the stock to decrease and invest or invest now? || This seems like a dumb push. If you make them sell chrome because it’s too powerful… then whoever buys it will just become a monopoly ? || such a waste of time for everyone involved

so what happens to whoever buys Chrome? are they targeted next? just an endless circlejerk? || Buying the dip || Was selling puts today. If it indeed breaks up then all investors get shares of Chrome which will be probably easier to managae as a standalone entity. 

This will recover in a week or two || I'm really sorry everyone! I finally bought stocks in google after contemplating it for years. Moments after I hit the purchase button, this news article was released... Now they are to be forced to sell chrome because they have a monopoly on the search engines, which odd because I use MS Edge and Bing regularly... Just so you are aware I am also looking to purchase stock in Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia in the upcoming days. s/ || I'm loading up, Gmail isn't going anywhere || Why can't Chrome form its own org and split? || Oh wow.  This will change everything.   I no longer have to close Firefox and open Chrome in order to use the Google searcher. || The only reason to use Chrome is its integration with all Google services. I guess Firefox will become more popular again. || Bought the dip! 

Even with a delayed eventual sale of Chrome, the reason Google Search is dominant is due to capability and not ""default"" in Chrome. || Overreaction. 

Inverse reddit. Mute out the noise. Buy leaps. DCA shares. If you don't think GOOGL is a monster, go stick to ETFs. || Google is fcked. I don't believe google will prevail. Gov doesn't understand tech. 

However google has strong portfolio with Google Ventures.  Google is not one trick pony. || I think it's funny considering OpenAI is gouging search result shares at a pretty hefty rate. I'd imagine as OpenAI keeps developing Gpt products the share Google has on search results is only going to shrink. 

As for Google being the default browser on a significant portion of devices/products I don't personally understand the issue. Shrinking their share will only cause Apple or others to move in gaining a disproportionate share. || I’m ok with this… I already gave up on Chrom tbh

_looks left, then right_

Edge is better 🤫  || How does this make sense?  Chrome is a free product.  Google spends a lot of money maintaining the software, so the browser itself is a money loser.  How does a buyer make money with it?  The equivalent is Firefox, which relies on handouts from Google and the organization still cannot keep its head above water. || No idea. 6% down off news we already knew and I'd thought we'd digested. || Market was too busy pumping bitcoin/MSTR to notice || honestly i don’t understand || And yet Apple is only slightly down.

I swear that company is like a cockroach, Cupertino could take a direct hit from an ICBM and still come out smelling like roses.

Wanna talk cellular monopoly, look no further than their parasitic app store. Do nothing take 30% 

I have a pretty decent book library on my iPad and unfortunately I am tied to their ecosystem FOREVER because of it. Either I have an I product or I can't read my books.

Honestly I'm surprised they haven't just thrown iSearch out there, people would flock to it because everything Apple related is just better. 

The failure of the Vision Pro and Europe telling them to go screw themselves over their charging ports were great days. || This is pure retail selling. Even the official leak was known already before market open, yet no drop. The process will take atleast until next summer and Chrome sell of wont happen under Trump. || I've been buying on the news, but didn't get the memo on the DOJ's recommendation for Google to sell Chrome, which is probably at least 90% of their revenue.  Maybe I'm too dumb to see the writing on the wall.  This proposal is moronic, but I've seen stranger and more shocking things in my life.  

For example, a few years ago, I snuck up on my (now ex) girlfriend surfing online.  She didn't know I was behind her so didn't bother to hide her screen.  I peeked and fuckin saw something that rocked me to this day: she was using Bing to search.  And I don't mean to search for a Chrome download....I mean looking for Avengers movie reviews n shit. || Bots trading || Apparently because the headlines said chrome. But people got glimpse into the report and it had more specifics and other things other than chrome. || Tbh, I've only got conspiracy theories. || Efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), I’m a strong believer in semi-strong EMH. Meaning all the news you see is factored into the price of a stock by the time it is released but insider information is not. What you’re seeing is most likely pre-adjustments being made before more news is released. How far into the future will it be released? No clue, but just know you probably won’t be able to time the market with public news. || No clue. Hedgies felt like stepping in to short? 

I bought the dip || Pump and dump 😃 || The Trump Administration will probably settle this case.

* Trump has said many times that he does NOT want to break Google up - which is why Alphabet stock pumped on the election result. This aligns with his ""pro America"" stance - that the USA should do everything to retain it's absolute dominance in technology (""*China is afraid of Google*""). Trump's main issue with Google is censorship - so he'll likely drop this lawsuit in exchange for some sort of compromise on censorship
* Google hasn't even filed an appeal - and it is within their right to. Realistically, even if a breakup was eventually ordered, it'll be at least 5 years away or more. It'll just drag out until nothing happens (Microsoft does this all the time). The DOJ has had a piss-poor track record of going after tech companies and there's nothing to suggest that it's going to be different now (especially with a republican Supreme Court - who will likely lean protectionist)
* Pedo Gaetz, who has previously come out as anti-big tech, is no longer up for AG. Suspect the new appointee will be more frieldy to big corporates and more aligned with Trump's overall agenda

That's just my guess but who the hell knows. || Same. What matters is the stance of next administration, though the next administration probably won't drop the case entirely. They might use it as a barginchip. || Pretty sure Trump has said he doesn't like Google. He says he Googles himself and only sees negative articles lmao. And of course that means they're fake and bad for America. || A move like this in the market shows me GOOG is being attacked regardless of president. || Same || I had a 175 CSP so I won’t be DCA’ing lol || Nothing is heavily undervalued in this market || Same || Can you explain? I am invested obviously not selling but undervalued sure heavily not so sure || Alphabet C now with a 6% sale for Black Friday, what a nice move from them 😂 || As a non-US person it’s so funny to see the DOJ trying so hard to destroy one of their very own American tech giants with so much valuable IP in AI and across various industries. What’s the end goal here? They’re behaving no different to the CCP essentially. || Lina Khan doesn’t care. She just hates to us country and wants to hurt us. She’s doing as much damage as she can before losing the chairmanship.  || That’s not how Google’s business model works.

Google’s Healthcare & Science divisions are worthless without Google Cloud & AI. Waymo is not profitable and is being propped up by Google Search. YouTube will likely lose its profitability once it begins serving less effective ads because it got severed from Google Search, Google Chrome, Android — or the other divisions that actually collect customer data.

Google is profitable because of how well the different parts work together. It’s impossible to see how Google’s valuation would improve if you take it apart.

The DOJ is completely off the mark here. The primary beneficiary of Google’s monopoly isn’t Google.

It’s the consumer who gets free Gmail… free access to Google’s productivity and office apps… fast and reliable search… and all the advancements that come from Google’s investments in AlphaFold.

FYI the last time the DOJ pulled this move with Bell Systems… local telephone service rates began to rise faster than the rate of inflation, as they were no longer subsidised by the long-distance rates.

And of course, Bell Labs’ prestige faded away too, leaving it as a shell of its former self. || Fair. But Google isn't literally being run by a con man. || Some of the spinoffs couldn't make it on their own as they are funded by Google. We don't even know if Youtube makes a profit after cost and they probably get subsidized servers from Google. Waymo is a money loser and would need to be funded if they were split off from Google.

Also Chrome doesn't make any money. || $10 billion in profits but yes, point taken. Markets price companies into perpetuity and anticipate significant market loss without Chrome || Alphabet is carried by Google (through advertising) and YouTube (again, through advertising). || Don't compare to Tesla lol || I wouldn’t mind baby Alphabets. The parts separated would be much more then the whole. || [deleted] || True. The biggest drawback of google is it's current leadership, that prefers playing politics over profits.

Splitting it would give us significant chance for at least SOME baby companies having actual profit-oriented CEO. || I would love to know this too. Google search and chrome are both free to consumers and have numerous competitors. The problem is the competitors suck. I'm not sure why that's Google's problem or means they should subject to an antitrust lawsuit. || Probably.

Hard disagree.

A stand alone YouTube would still be the most profitable

Chrome and chromebooks would be a fine business with YouTube.

Google cloud doesn’t need Waymo.

And so on. 

There’s a couple (ick) synergies here and there.  Buttheres no existential need for all of these and search and everything else to be under one (listless) CEO. || True.  But can we discuss how basically useless he’s been?

* The vast majority of viewers don't pay for the service.

* There's a ton of storage costs for all their videos, and 3.7 million new videos are uploaded every day.

* The vast majority of their videos are net losers that will never recoup their storage costs and other expenses.

* A big chunk of their ad revenue goes to the content creators themselves, plus there's a ton of other expenses that I didn't even list here. || Going private requires buying everyone else out.

If I buy a google phone, it makes sense that the default browser is a google browser. As long as the default browser can be changed, I don't see what the big hoopla is.

But forcing Google to sell Chrome and committing itself not to develop an alternative internet browser for 5 years is about the most ridiculous thing you can do if you want to fight monopolism. Free market means the best product decides. The hurdles to creating a search engine are not high, Google simply offers the best product. If that goes through, every company with high margins is monopolistic. NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, Amazon... || Exactly lmao, this doesn't become a Meta esque moment until it is probing around it's pre Covid record from 2020 and social media is hating on the stock.

Compare it to Google, who had a surprise leapfrog in AI by OpenAI but no one rules them out coming on top because of the company's dominance in search, streaming (Youtube), mobile (Android) and ads. || >Free market means the best product decides

Its not free market, each one of these companies own tens of thousands of patents. Its 70781 in Google case.

So if i ever literally ripped off shit google does, made Chrome with blackjack and hookers, i would get sued the very next day. If i ignored all of that the law enforcement would break down my door and use force to subdue my company.

There is no such thing as ''best product'' when patent system only allows one such product on the market to begin with, thus establishing endless government sanctioned monopolies. USA doesn't have any free market, in any sense what so ever, especially when hilariously the Scandinavian countries known for their ''socialism'' ranks more free, more ruggedly capitalistic than USA.

There is a great video on youtube ''You Hate all these Companies for the SAME Reason'', that presents this very well. It also very well explains why enshittification is so easy to pull off and consumers can't do anything about it.

>is about the most ridiculous thing you can do if you want to fight monopolism

Also why its ridiculous? Explain it in economic theory. I say if they kill the company that holds **market power**, it would simply make the market more free and competitive. It is also the very first thing all governments would do if they wanted to solve such a thing.

My price target for EoY is seriously just $180, and it may have already been seen. || I literally said that in my comment already. I personally don't think Vance will have much sway over DJT. DJT is focused on beating the rest of the world and bolstering US business. That's why he's proposing massive tariffs on China and Europe. See his quote from last month when asked if they should be broken up. He has his reservations about breaking Google up. I think he would propose a lesser remedy to the anti competitve practice at hand which is paying Apple to be the default on Safari.

Yes they do, and it’s absurdly profitable.  It has been for many years.

A lot of people don’t realize that because they’ve been fed the nonsensical lie that Netflix is the only airquotes profitable streamer.  People have been erroneously trained to forget that YouTube exists and is a streaming service.  

> but running the world’s biggest streamer with more than 3.7 million new videos uploaded daily is expensive af… 

That too is what would best be called “truthy”.  That means something that most people would casually assume to be true but actually isn’t.  YouTube infrastructure is so massive that the economies of scale are unheard of.  Their CDN is second to none so a lot of what people think must be expensive for them is really offloaded to the end of the distribution line, ISPs and related parties.


> and don’t forget YouTube still needs to pay out the YouTube Creators 55% of all ad revenue.

Yeah... imagine only getting paid 45 cents of every dollar for doing nothing.  I’ll take it.  I assume you recognize MasterCard and visa as financial powerhouses?  They do it by skimming 1.75 to 2%.  So skimming 45% is pretty damn lucrative.  Even greedy Apple only skims 30%, and I’m sure you’d agree Apple is lucrative too.

Not only that, but YouTube only pays out money based on success.  Only videos with big revenue trigger significant payment to the content maker.  Studios and Netflix would die for such an arrangement.  They have to front billions in content creation and then roll the dice hoping that a few of their investments work.  With YouTube, it’s structure so they *only* pay for hits, proportionally.

YouTube is a gold mine.  And for reasons that should be obvious, Google is very happy continung to keep that realization under the radar for as long as they have.

But back to the key point: YouTube is a wonderful monstrously profitable busones with or without google docs.   Google cloud is a wodnefuly profitable monster with or without Waymo.  And so on.

Your implication that YouTube is some borderline fledgling operation that can only turn a profit if it’s kept together is totally false.

> Also… Google Cloud’s biggest selling point over AWS and Azure is that it’s integrated with Google 

False as false could be.

> Like… you can take your website traffic from Google Search and run your data analytics on Cloud.

Wait, you think those are the only ways to track traffic and that there’s no competition in analytics?  You’re just wrong my friend.



> The whole thing works together because it does.

Yeah... no. || Look I’m not here to bash the stock, but you’re factually wrong.

At the current peak of $164 its nowhere near its ATH of $195.  

And it’s been dead money for several years.  There’s hundreds of better performing stocks over that time.

But what I was mainly referring to is for anyone that’s old and knew google when it started and has tracked it to today... There was a time when google was mind blowingly amazing.  They’d produce innovations almost weekly that seemed impossible.  We used to pay $25 a month in 1990’s dollars for mediocre and capacity-limited email.  Google said “we just invented unlimited email, where the capacity grows faster than you can use it.  And it’s packed with features.  And the price is free.   And it’s available... Right now.  No waiting.”

Even their search was unheard of.  And maps.  And a hundred other head spinning innovations.

Since the current CEO took over neither you or I could point to a single amazing innovation by google.  They’ve just milked the old stuff to death.  Worse, they’ve degraded or discontinued most of it.

They’ve gone from a source of inspiration to a lame and evil ad agency. || [deleted] || The stock has performed amazingly well the last 3 years.

Just look at a 3 year chart from today.

AMAZING RIGHT?

lol

GTFO || Didn’t he state that he doesn’t want employees talking about politics after the election was over?

As for the search, if you want the right answers, it’s not hard to skew left when the right is spitting out everything that pops in their mind. People want the right/truthful answers. AI is just going to bury shitty results.

It’s not just google’s staff that skews to the left. Most college educated people skew to the left in the US. If college degrees were a requirement to vote, Kamala would’ve won. And that’s a fact. || Demographically, it isn't some conspiracy that young, well-educated, creative/forward looking individuals are left-leaning lol. That is hardly Google ""playing politics"". || reality has a left-leaning bias. Search results reflect that. If I ask google about the circumference of earth, the results shouldn't be propping up flat earth conspiracies. If I ask google about climate change, it shouldn't be propping up oil companies saying climate change is nothing to worry about. Reality has a left-leaning bias. 

Don't get mad that google isn't prioritizing misinformation, be mad at the people spreading misinformation. || > definitely skewed hard left during the past few years

LOL, this just betrays a complete lack of knowledge on how Google functions. 

The Google bot is what creates the index, there is not someone furiously copying/pasting links into a search results page for every query. The Google bot does not weight very heavily some fucking mommy blog or tinydickpatriot.org when calculating the position in the results, nor should they, especially when there are better sources of information, like .gov or .edu sites.

This is how Google has functioned since its inception, right wingers just have this idiotic persecution complex that is impossible to shake. || I agree. If they wanted to deal a blow to Google on the way out they should've suggested Google detach YouTube. That would've been significant at least. 

Side note: I already use Firefox and think it's great. || This is what I don't get. This isn't the same as the MS/Windows anti-trust from years ago, but you install an OS and you have to search out Google Chrome. It's not being forced on anyone at all. Chrome isn't even the best browser, yet people will actively seek it out and download it.

I buy Pixel phones because I really like them a lot and they work well. I expect Google products on a Google phone. Just like I expect Apple products on an Apple device. || It's about weakening Google's search monopoly.

Chrome gathers a ton of data that other browsers can't that helps ensure it's search dominance. For example if you search on something at Google, Chrome will tell Google how long you stayed on the page that you clicked on that search link for, which will help them determine if that's a good or bad link. Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. can't do the same thing when you're using their search on Chrome, hence it entrenches Google Search's dominance, which not even Microsoft can compete against, which is why the DOJ sued them in the first place. || Don't you find it a little unnerving that your joke was taken seriously?

Would be like Amazon selling off one of the two, they wouldn't care about the stock price of an entirely different company || So the DOJ is doing all this and Google can create a spinoff company, buy Chrome and resume doing exactly what they're being sued for? That seems like a waste. 

If that's not what you're saying then I'm confused bc it certainly seems like they want Google to outright sell Chrome. || The Answer: No One Knows. Google doesn’t release YouTube profitability… only revenues.

In truth, it’s probably profitable… but it’s unclear just how profitable it is… because there is nothing comparable to it. Netflix isn’t comparable at all… because Netflix has a limited collection of titles.

There is only 42,000 hours of playable content on Netflix. YouTube has 300,000 hours of new content uploaded to it EVERY SINGLE FUCKING HOUR.

So… anyone who wants to estimate YouTube profitability using Netflix numbers is 100% out of their mind.

>> In 2013, Lu Yong, an entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province in China, was arrested and charged with selling counterfeit medicines. But Lu was not your typical drug dealer: diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, it was his own search for affordable cancer treatment that landed him in court. At the time, imatinib, the approved therapy for his cancer, cost 23 500 yuan (US$3777) monthly, equal to the average yearly household income. Virtually bankrupted by 2 years on the drug, Lu set out in search of an alternative and found a generic produced in India under a compulsory licence. At only 3000 yuan ($436) a month, it offered him—and then others—a lifeline. Spreading the word on patient message boards, Lu became an intermediary, using his personal bank account to link patients to suppliers, not profiting personally other than receiving free medication.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

They cant sell their drugs for more because everyone know how to get the generic from a pharma company, to which they are a dime a dozen over there...

Case and point, you can buy Tirzeptide from China for about $0.60/mg. The max dose of Mounjaro is 15mg/wk. A month supply at max dose is 60mg. That $6/mo in China... All you have to do is mix in some water and inject. The same thing here is $500-$1000...

And thats for small quantities... if you buy it in larger quantities price goes down even more. And yes these are almost always fully tested and verified. Not some bathtub quality nonsense. These are real pharma companies that make all sort of generic stuff. They just dont care about rule of law unless its something China itself cares about. But if its a foreign company being hurt? The CCP doesnt care unless they are forced to care.

So this is a case where the companies are forced to sell in China else they will lose any and all legal rights. Yes China does recognize the rights even if they dont enforce it. But if these companies didnt sell in China, then this would legitimize the generic brands and possibly allow them to sell legally overseas. Its a sticky wicket. || A few bits:
- there is the government reimbursement market, but there is also self pay. So you can get low pricing on the NRDL, or (for small volume high price drugs) have people pay for it themselves
- pricing has been improving. You still have long term negative pricing demand dynamics (mandatory rebates, etc) but it’s driven by volume
- even at lower pricing, that’s still volume and no-one sells at a loss. 
- Margins are probably less than a third of the US, but most of the development costs are a sunk cost by the time you decide whether to put it on the market or not. Local companies who only run their clinical costs in China can make money from development costs.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

India's govt is beholden to him, nothing will come of this. || So hard to time these things. I sold INDA ETF when price was at $40 after Adani Hindenburg report first came out.

So, after Trump takes over, if the attorney general of Trump (Matt Gaetz if confirmed), asks the NY US prosecutor to drop the case, it will be done.

They are going to play the cards of nationalism, international propaganda, etc. || Hindenburg Research has been releasing non-stop updates and they all point to media as well as regulators in India being implicitly complicit (like they ignore the bad stuff, not that they actively help).

India buying oil is in line with western interests. || Do you expect people to take you seriously if you say Elon musk isn’t intelligent?  || Yes, but large companies don't operate in a vacuum and negative sentiment in stocks for India sector can spread into panic for investors.

Conversely, perhaps if you still believe in India ETF, can buy the dips now if it's irrational fear. || Adani targeted for backing the soon-to-be most powerful person in the world?

Honestly, how it should work is that if a country allows its officials to be bribed, that country should be sanctioned and not allowed to export their goods to our country. Developed nations only go full sicko mode when Russia starts invading Ukraine but when developing countries are unable to fight corruption, developed countries allow it to happen. Just look at some of these countries in Africa who have a terrorism problem. They need help from a militia but only Russia is willing to supply a private army.

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

Therefore create a new market with the original having 100% market share.  
  
My question is also how we define markets and market share. What if a new product competes with a previous market, and wins out to the point of replacing the old market with it's new market? Ex. Landline phone -> dumb cellphone -> smartphone. Or horse and carriage, gasoline car, electrical/hybrid cars."

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one.

They expect something, Nvidia delivers and goes beyond and the market is still disappointed. || This is great news for the market. This entire week has been a little ugly and it felt like there were no good catalysts to push us further up. Hopefully this does the trick. || EPS up 120% yoy, but stock price up 190% yoy. So should it drop 70/190= 37%? || NVDA starting to look and act like a proper megacap bluechip with predictable growth and a balance sheet you'd want to hang on your wall as art.

Who knew? || So much gains, and they do a dividend of 1 cent per share. That's just insulting. || Exceptional. || Growth has slowed last several quarter in a row. Market might need to accept it's beginning to peak. || I've been long NVDA for 11 years. A pre-earnings surge followed by a post-earnings dip is typical, no matter how good the numbers are. It's not about ""some investors are disappointed,"" or ""the numbers are good, but not good enough."" It's simply an established cycle that investors expect and therefore perpetuate. || Going to be hard to have huge beat when everything is sold out for next year. || Crazy || I wonder if the overheating issue with the Blackwell might pop up sometime with all the new orders going out now, thatchip better perform. || Well, damn, now that I know about that $0.01 dividend I wish I'd held shares instead of calls. || Nvda also sells to sovereign. Lotta countries in Asia are buying. || Look at the trend in gross margins though if you want to know why the stock is down AH.

Last Quarter gross margin was 75.15% that was down from the prior quarter of 78.35%

This quarter gross margin was 74.6%, which was down from 75.15% Next quarter guide for gross margin is 73 - 73.5%

This is not a good trend and shows Nvidia is loosing pricing power. || And yet in the after hours market it keeps going steadily down. I wonder if people see an AI wall coming up. || First $120 and then maybe next quarter $180 || Options holders hosed. Love to see it. || Just trying to confirm is the conference call coming up at 5 o’clock Eastern time? || You can’t stop these guys.  I will be buying more tomorrow || Sylvia Jablonski on Bloomberg seriously just said she thinks Nvidia's share price can double in the next few years... || why is it down aftermarket? || I reckon we’d be getting a lot of price target adjustments upward but that said a selloff into December after the week’s volatility clears for the stock. Reckon funds would jump on “Finance chief Colette Kress said Blackwell shipments are scheduled to begin in the current quarter, but warned that supply constraints will likely linger well into coming year.”.  Would be buy the dip moments for retails I guess || Terrific story, forecasted it years ago, those that stuck with it are happy, those that sold 2022 are still crying. But now the grinding diminishing returns chart kicks in. If Amazon's new upcoming chip even moderately impresses, that is direct hole in NVIDIA earnings. Same for Microsoft. Tesla will stick to NVDA. So data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in, say 2026 or 2027. As next gen chips sales drop, market saturation kicks in to level growth. So I saw it easy to forecast 15 to 145, but 145 to 200 or 145 to 500 seems exponentially riskier to assume as a medium term target. Take Amazon. If Amazon is happy with whatever chips it proposes (even if nowhere near Blackwell levels), that drop in sales would hurt NVIDIA (or just the news). Unless other AI consumers ping Amazon for its chips, they may very well replace Amazon as a NVIDIA client. On the other hand, should NVDA drop to 120s, the P/E becomes a too good to be true, a steal. Either or I remain long on NVDA but I no longer expect the terrific growth story I once had with Tesla in 2020 or NVDA to date. || Yeah and I sec I finally buy into they my call are worthless. Just my luck || Great quarter yet the share has not moved up a bit. 

I am afraid we are coming to the end of a bubble... || I didn’t know when will be its next split. This stock is hot af || Maximum revenue they can generate is $45-50B per quarter, then it’ll saturate. Current prices assume 100% YOY revenue growth for the next 10 yrs, expecting revenue to be $350B/quarter at some point. Unfortunately, the world only needs so many data center chips. || The beginning of the end. 

RemindMe! 3 months || Excellent! I expected good earnings, I held and will look to reap the rewards in the years to come || Reddit: why no market cap double $7T || This company has a cheat code for shitting gold. Crazy profits. || Incredible numbers. Should do better with next administration, all big tech should. || [deleted] || Rapidly slowing revenue growth QoQ || Then why isn’t IT FUCKING 200$ || Until China invades Taiwan and NVDA becomes worthless overnight. || Sayonara puts || Priced for better growth imo. Beating soft guidance - meh.

0 missteps or craters. Until then - yolo. || It's joever || Are my Spy calls cooked tomorrow or no lol? || [deleted] || > This trend is unlikely to change in 2025

World War 3 has been priced-in. || The hyperscalars are seeing their stocks struggle 

Why keep spending so much capex when it just hurts your stocks? || Unlikely to change until 2027* as they are fully sold until there already. I'd even say most likely until 2030... || Yes but the next quarters the growth yoy will be back to ~20%, still great but multiples should be adjusted accordingly || Not necessarily. If Amazon's new upcoming chip even moderately impresses, that is direct hole in NVIDIA earnings. Same for Microsoft. Tesla will stick to NVDA. SO data centers are being built but we do not know what chips go in, say 2026 or 2027. || And yet you still see comments in random threads of people saying AI has produced no results for companies. People just putting their heads in the sand I guess. (And plenty more companies beyond Nvidia utilizing AI have been posting higher earnings — not just the top dog) || Every. Single. Quarter. || I glad about the lackluster response. It allows me to get into some calls at a better entry price for the eventual spike up. || Uh, that very much hasn’t been the case outside of last quarter.

I’m actually fairly sorry to be negative, but at this point, the performance of the entire semiconductor group is speaking for itself in a bad way. The AI story is intact, sure, but the way semis are acting price wise says some of the winnings out of the Oct 2023 major bottom are fixin’ to unwind in 2025. || It isn’t even sold off that much after hours || why does it feel like they are trying to shove AI up our asses, and we don't really need it ? || JPOW has you by the ... || Thetagang sends their regards. || Ah the golden days of the kangaroo market. || Nvidia AI ironically was first used to make mic quality sound better during COVID 

They don't trust it 100% to not mess up badly for their earnings calls though. || Yes, and that is what concerns me. Great GP (>70%), great orders - all I fear is accounting irregularities as it is too fast and consistently over guidance.  I hope not for the market, but I worry. || And then we have car company Tesla eho barely makes finally some money and skyrocketed just after some promises :D || And then we have car company Tesla who barely makes finally some money and skyrocketed just after some promises :D || It’s to get into mutual funds and ETFs that require dividends || It’s only so dividend ETFs can buy it || Yeah not sure what I will spend my 10 cents this quarter on || It's there so Huang can buy a yacht in cash every quarter || It’s a governance hack || no lol flat || 'is the market Chinese parents?"" || Market is greedy. Ugh || Sort of crazy because the expected numbers were already stratospheric. || Guide was only $425m higher than expected || When you're priced to perfection, above expectations doesn't cut it. || the guide is light. the beat was good. || nah the beat was good, unfortunately the guide is a bit light for bw coming up next quarter. || Extremely dependent on hyperscalars continuing to expand their CapEx even as their stocks struggle. 

That data center number is insane. I wonder what happens if one of the hyperscalars decide the demand is not growing as fast as their CapEx. || Brother, Nvidia is worth $3.57T , what are you expecting? Their current TTM revenue is $113B. Their current price is 31x their sales. They are posting great numbers, but the stock performance has been beyond exceptional. The stock is down like 1.5% after hours, that's not what disappointed looks like.

This is why people lose money with stocks. It's not just about buying a good business, it's buying it at a good price. || went from 1 trillion to nearly 4 trillion in a year what do you expect lol || Not as bad as the previous quarter. The fluctuation after hours are within the margin of noise. As far as I’m concerned, this is great. Exceeds expectations and no large sell off. Holding steady. || When you look at the non earnings reaction, literally, what do you have to even talk about?

Stop playing options then. No one cares about short term price movement. || I mean, the way semiconductors have traded as a group since July is beginning to speak loudly here folks. 

I would not be expecting much next year. For the market to continue, it’s going to need to find another sector to lean on, but the most likely case is that semis are too connected now and a bit of an unwind instead of flattish is going to be packing some serious punch. || People expect NVDA to do well. The stock is down because of this and is likely not a market catalyst. || Or at least a 5% drop won’t bring the entire market with it || Did they provide guidelines for growth that can make up for that? || NVIDIA is a startup so there are no reasons to give dividends || Insulting for who? They’re treating me very well as a shareholder. || It’s for ETF inclusion, not shareholder returns. || Blackwell is coming 2025 || You just have to accept you missed the boat at this price. It's just way to risky with growth slowing. || It’s been a hell of a ride, but the train is slowing || Lol I've seen this one before, and it's wrong.

Well, it's not going to happen with that attitude. || Overheating is a non story.

|-|-|-|-| || Why, is the next administration buying the gpus? || Lol, beats across the board is good to me. people sell on the the news. Id be surprised if it's not up by Friday close || It's really not this is the average growth this year. || I think the slight down trend after market means that expectations are slightly ahead of what we see, but not by much. The delta between the two is getting smaller. <2% is noise IMO. || Can you say where? Power considerations or hurdles? || Time to buy some more DLR REIT stock then. || Because they want to be properly positioned for the future. Current stock price is irrelevant if AI becomes the only way to run a business and grow 

We simply do not know yet || Because, in the case of MSFT they can't handle the insane demand for the product. || Huh? How are their stocks struggling? Meta is up 60+% on the year. Google up 25%. Amazon up 35%. Microsoft is lagging but still up 10%. 

Weird comment. 

They need to spend so they don't become the next Intel. Once a great company that stopped innovating to reduce cost and focus on short term profits, but got killed long term. || Because they don’t care about short term fluctuations in their stock and are doing what they believe is best for the business long term || Because their stock is going to hurt a lot more of they're last past the post on the race for AI || It’s like clockwork at this point. Gotta love that volatility! || Unlike humans, the algos responsible for most trades don't tend to make money by not actively trading. The almost instant lurches aren't fun to watch in real time, at least when the beat and raise doesn't beat the RNG ""whisper number.""

I tend to look at revenue growth, which I was expected to be linear sequentially, because it has been statistically linear, and this time it was above that previous high-r^2 best-fit line. I'm happy with it. Vehicle revenue growth, which they clarified was related to AI, not infotainment, was accelerating. || Why is it intact when there's been no ROI? || AI is about more than generating cat photos or cleaning up emails. || Demand is outpacing supply, that’s why. Data centers can’t buy enough of these. || Not permitted under the law. || uhh... Niagara Falls! || Halls!

fa la la la la la la la la la || my back very much against the wall || Balls! || Yeah, I wouldn't mind if it would stop running and stay in a fair value range for some time. Then any market correction could make it a good entry point also for new investors. If it keeps running then there's the shadow of a massive drop all the time behind the corner. || AR growing at an insane rate vs revs is literally the same red flag people caught with enron lol.

This filing looks mad sus. If insider selling ramps up in the next 2 months this could get ugly || elon sends out a press release about FSD and trump..  stock surges..  it aint fuckin right. || We are a vibes-based economy || to paraphrase an article, tesla is a bet on corruption paying off || That actually makes a lot of sense. Still seems rather insultingly low. Matters not to me, too deep in bubble territory for my tastes now. || This was insightful. It makes me respect NVDA's understanding of business even more. Appreciate you spreading info! || Actually it is from when they IPoed at ~$1 and that was a good dividend then. || Seeing this now. Appreciate the response || Best comment lol || [deleted] || they're fucked if Amazon or Google decide to cut down on Capex. There will be a point where they have enough shovels to dig and will need no more || Yea that’s the breaking point right the F there. || They switch to a cheaper alternative || If/when Nvidia misses earnings, it will be a blood bath || I love the rational responses like this one. Thank you!! || So few understand this. Reality is even if AI transforms the world it doesn’t mean the stocl keeps going up || Most of us bought NVDA years ago || 99% of people who buy stocks don't know what market cap is and have no concept of valuations. You are wasting your breath. || In fact, they are actually underperforming. Profit is up 94% Y/Y while the shares are up like 190%. 

There is a lot of future growth being baked in right now. || TTM is a fairly useless metric at the best of times and a completely useless metric when a company is growing like Nvidia is. Revenue literally up 100%+ percent yoy || I think you’re misunderstanding my point. It’s not whether it’s down right now. The guidance and the beat were significant enough that the news can act as a positive catalyst for the entire market going forward. Had the news been bad (or just really good) coupled with general market sentiment that seems to have turned sour this week, I feared for the worst. || Let’s hope. Honestly NVDA will be at 160 by end of year. I just want to shake off these last few days and get the momentum back || Sure, but it's still insulting. || The valuation is what really makes investing in NVDA now WAY too risky. It's at nearly a 36 price to sales ratio right now, which is utterly insane with how expensive it is. || The hell are you coming at me for. I'm just stating what the data says. || Not slowing, but slowing acceleration || Last year NVIDIA went up 208%, this year, (YTD) it's up 202%. It's hardly slowing. || You're using guidance deltas and not pure rates. || I’ve been in this position many times in 11 years. Awesome earnings but dip anyway. || Yeah wtf. If it goes down 10% then i think it fair to say but fuck until 10% its just a tiny drop. || Thanks || Come back in 2044 || That’s why a lot of people lose money, buying at inflated value because they don’t even consider valuation || Lower corporate taxes || This year is only 3 quarters... || [deleted] || That's exactly my thoughts. Even if AI doesn't pay off in a huge way, the risk of being left behind is too great. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon can all easily afford for this not to pay off, but none of them can afford to miss out. || Seems risky to put all chips in one bet || What's it do?

Definitely doesn't fix their mic quality || Not. Permitted. Under the law. || mommy || I really think about are all the orders correctly booked.  Yes, they have been in business a long time but with explosive growth come new hires / high work pressure leading to short cuts.  I seen it too many times. || > This filing looks mad sus

in what way? || a bet against America || bUbBle territory lol. Keep sitting on the sidelines even though it really isn’t all that late to print with Nvidia || I also chuckled at the dividend, but having it as a low cost entry cost for other opportunities seems wise for a company both established and growing || It was $1.1b more last quarter 

$2.2b in Q1. 

Then $3b in that one crazy quarter end 2023. || Seems like we’re there or almost there, with the benefits of scaling appearing to plateau. There just isn’t enough training data out there to justify building out more and more compute ad infinitum. Eventually the field will have to transition away from bruteforcing through raw compute to figuring out how to squeeze the most juice out of the data orange. || [deleted] || Just like the Internet. || Technically it does if it provides a fundamental economic input like labour - I.e digital labour replacing human labour. || Actually, it kinda does. || I'm not disagreeing that the guidance and beat weren't significant, I just don't see NVDA being a market catalyst anymore when people expect them to beat. I do think this market will continue to go up until mid January for many reasons, just don't believe ""NVDA is a catalyst."" || That might be tough given endless headlines about unqualified knuckle-draggers being appointed to key govt positions. I realize a lot of Americans want to tear shit down and start over but the market doesn’t like it much. || Lol, pretty sure he meant ""you"" as in people in general, not you specifically. || I wasn't coming at you, I mean investors buying up here are taking on a lot of risk. I have no position I accepted I missed the boat on this stock. I believe like you said it's near peak. || Q1 2023 was the bottom of the 2022 downcycle || [deleted] || Yes, that was typically the case pre-AI boom i do remember that but the sell off on earnings has only been a recent thing. || Oh wow that should completely change adoption of AI || Vancouver? || Build as in construction? Which part of the data center that you handle? || Peoria?

Loved my visits to Toronto when I lived in Michigan. || $CLS ? || Literally zero logic to this comment || They are not. The hyperscalers are making more money than they know what to do with. So instead of massive buybacks or acquisitions  they build data centers 

10 years ago these same companies used to spend 10s of billions buying up smaller companies and fringe ideas hoping to hit the next thing. Now they are investing in themselves by building the data centers. Having a massive data center that has practical use is less risk for shareholders than spending billions on shady startups that go nowhere 

Nvidia is just there to sell all the shovels in a gold rush || They have enough cash to not care. Where else are they going to spend their profits? || For sure, but it could be riskier to fall behind. || I'll bite.  I work in financial regulation.  AI has been *transformative* in the last ~12 months with communication surveillance systems.  The major providers are lining up to buy as much NVDA hardware as they can get their hands on, in the range of 9 figures each.

Those providers without bleeding-edge AI solutions just produce much shittier real-world results and are not signing new deals.  In this industry, AI *works*, it produces real-world results that give real-world RoI for broker-dealers who upgrade their monitoring packages to AI-enabled ones.  Fewer review staff, fewer false positives, more defensible compliance posture with the regulatory bodies, and reduced risk of fines for not meeting monitoring requirements.  Those fines can be dozens to hundreds of millions for failure to monitor regulated employees sufficiently, and they are handed out on the regular.

Financial communication monitoring like this is just one of the many, many industries people don't even know exists, and it's pumping money into Nvidia's pockets as fast as Jensen can produce chips for them.  Just in this market sector, there are other groups of providers pouring money into AI to monitor retail transactions directly for AML and sanctions violations.  Yet another group of companies are gobbling up AI for their direct trade surveillance offerings.

There you have 3 entire segments of industry that few laypeople have even heard of, all of which are spending hand over fist on NVDA's chips, and all of whom have positive RoI on that investment because it's just so damn good at what it does.

So yes, the dude above you is 100% right that the ""AI"" running on your computer is just the left over jokes and toys of what's happening with the real heavy lifting at the industrial level. || Google it || For my insurance by Manulife, I can chat with their AI that has read and understood my coverage contract and ask it questions instead of taking an hour on the phone to speak to a rep. Manulife reduced wait time by 15% last quarter || It will transition to inference which is where AMD beats NVDA || Most of the compute will be used at inference time. That's the growth story. By the end of the year, every person with a device will be using ai hundreds of times a day. There is no end to the need for compute. || Dude, Q2 2025 is when they will be ramping up Blackwell and are going to do $40-50b in quarterly revenue. You’d be gambling shorting then || That would be a really bad idea. || i love how people compare AI to the Internet, the usefulness of the Internet is widely different from this ""AI"" hype. LLM are just a glorified search engine using user data. || You might be right. I’m just saying that the market feels like it’s running on fumes right now and will take any bit of good news. What do you think about the direction from here to the end of the year? || I think the market is in a little bit of a denial phase right now. I don’t think the crazy will get priced in until mid January before the inauguration. || I read it as referring specifically to /u/Snowcups0. || I'm pretty sure nearly everyone was aware that you meant ""you"" as in people in general. || I don't see how beats matter. Their guidance delta is becoming smaller. They aren't going to keep beating the same rate when the delta gets smaller. || You agreed and disagreed in one sentence. || Were talking about how the numbers can be bigger, taxes is a huge factor || [deleted] || [deleted] || How so? The CEO of Google also practically said the same thing. The consequences of underspending are simply worse than the consequences of overspending. Trivial logic. 

Are you an Intel bagholder by any chance? Because they underspent on their foundries years ago. Now look at them trying to catch up. || Their stocks are struggling because FCF is plummeting. The CapEx data center arms race has only one winner. || Maybe. But what if the AI bubble pops and then you can buy cheaper? Why not spread out more spend? || >Financial communication monitoring

Does this mean monitoring bankers' e-mails to each other? Or like Visa transactions? || RemindMe! 6 months || There is more to AI than chatbots. Its applications are being used in tons of industries for help in R&D, surveillance, monitoring data, logistics, finance, healthcare, etc. 

Chatbots are just the lazy leftovers of this tech for quick widespread adoption but the real tech is being used much more effectively in nearly every industry || Exactly, the internet is massively more important than ""AI"" for a multitude of reasons. || lol no. || Tell pharma that, willya? || Problem with the English language || Dropbox or tiktok? || Lol I'm just curious about data center construction and interested to know which other industries or infrastructure aside from the server parts and components suppliers that may benefit from this boom. Electrical, cooling, switches, tiles, etc? || Well yes. All that FCF is going to Nvidia and other chip companies. But their idea is that this investment is going to increase their FCF in the long run || And what if there is no bubble and this technology continues to advance and become part of our daily lives? This could only be the start of significant gains if the technology continues to improve and find more use cases of widespread adoption 

I feel like people screaming bubble are the same people who would have said the beginning stages of mobile phone technology in the late 90s/Early 2000s was our peak and the bubble will surely pop any second. Nowadays cell phones are inherently crucial pieces of tech everyone needs for daily life which wasn’t the case when it first got off the ground. || Lol AI bubble? What bubble?

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",Ok_Criticism_558,2024-11-21 19:31:42,29,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/,None,"No, 100% U.S.

Other interesting stocks include ASML, I guess. || Only ASML || I'm German and the only German stocks I'd consider would be rheinmetall (+108% 1y) and sap (+61%). || Bought a ton of LVMH last week.

* 25% big pharma (Novartis and Roche)

Low revenue growth but solid 20% profit margin & 3-4% dividend yield. 
Megatrend: ageing population

* 15% in UBS

Up 60% in 2 years, got Credit Suisse assets for a bargain, US expansion targeted, half of their dividend is repayment of capital so it's tax-free

* 8% in Airbus because fuck Boeing. || I have almost 90% invested in US only but ironically, my foreign companies are performing the best, RRU and TSM(even tho listed on NDQ).

I think there are good high growth stocks available in Europe right now, besides obvious RRU there are ENX, ISP, SU, ASML, SAP that are on my watchlists. 

But I don't think I would invest in broader European market or single country, only stock picking. || I love European companies. Many are multi national corporations with deflated valuations due to regional bias imo. 

I am also a total contrarian on Germany. I am very bullish on Germany as I think they stand to benefit from consistent, cheap US natural gas due to the rising U.S. fracking GORs, and midstream capacity improvement. Unlike what the narrative is in Germany I think that their trade and overall relationship further integrates rather than splinters with the US under the new U.S. administration. I’m particularly interested in German auto manufacturers at the moment. || Bank of Georgia is trading cheaply and growing 15% YoY || Europe is a misunderstood market imo. There are some great companies that would do better if listed in the US but I would say the continent offers less downside and volatility than the US.

IMO everyone should invest globally, and not be heavily concentrated in any single nation. || Yeah, I looked at them. Then I looked back at the US || Hard to find any good opportunities as Europe is lagging the US in anything growth related, in a dramatic fashion. The political climate is nonsense. What used to be the leading country once, Germany, has turned into a burden of policies and rules that go nowhere. Their choice on nuclear energy explains that well. I am sure that a skilled investor would be able to find some gems, but for the time and risk that it would take you for doing that, I'd rather look at the US market. || I do so simply because I don't have to deal with FOREX. But there's definitely less opportunities || I saw something about Fielmann group on X. But I need to look more closely at it. Could be something. || No || I am a huge AG1 bull which is Germany based. European Carvana || What's point investing in Europe companies. US has more companies, better returns historically, and more liquidity. || Other than Ferrari hell no || The only one I have currently is Zeal Networks (TIMA) and it has done pretty well over the year or so that I have owned it--its up like 25 percent and pays a decent dividend. I don't really know if it is a good investment now, though, after it has had a good run. I also chose it specifically because it seemed to fit with the current economic downturn in Europe esp. Germany, as their main business is running lotteries. || I own a number of EU stocks, they are much more attractively valued than US ones. 

BTI, BUD, BASFY, RHHBY

Unfortunately they don't perform like US stocks but the dividends are nice. Maybe they'll pick up once the Ukrainian thing is over, maybe they won't. They were cheap || personal fav high quality names in europe are asml, rms.pa & sgn.wa || Own NVO and I am sure I own more or parts of it.  However, the total market traded is small compare to other Asian or Middle East funds.  These etfs are losing steam lately. India was my favorite. || Porsche, DHL? German stocks look really undervalued || No. || I like Rheinmetall, but I havent bought yet. || respectfully, never had any interest in investing in Europe and probably never will. The open immigration policies are not good for stock returns - plain and simple. || I like the ESIN ETF. Some quality European companies that are at least able to follow the SP500's returns for a bit.

Being long USA and underweight everything else is in style now. I don't know when it will reverse, but for the same amount of cash flow you'll pay a hefty premium to hold US stocks vs stocks pretty much anywhere else. || Declining populations, regulations that cripple businesses, high taxes, unsustainable cradle to grave entitlements, massive brain drain, and American isolationism forcing Europe to actually pay for the defense of Europe. A new American administration imposing tariffs and  will demand Europe opens it markets and end their protectionist policies…. Only a complete moron would invest in Europe outside of a few select companies. || No. I don’t like EU regulations. You never know what they’re going to ban or make illegal next. Id be more inclined to invest in the heavily manipulated Chinese markets since at least i might catch a wild swing.  || Maybe in 2027-8 The United States is moving into protectionism. Since Europe is our largest trading partner. The current administration is looking to take more, give less, it means American companies are more likely to be the outperformers and you're going to see reduced earnings potential in Europe as a whole. I'm sure there will be some companies that outperform but trying to figure out which ones and why, it's too early to even attempt. What it is doing is setting up one hell of a good buying opportunity, just not yet, PE's likely to get lower all else equal. If we get a Democrat elected in 2028, I would be all over the European trade || Volkswagen is at sale || EU sucks from a business perspective. Maybe Asml but why not just go with tsm anyway.

I don’t own it but I regret not getting into Spotify. || USA markets are a million miles ahead from other markets. the 2nd best is India. || I am not as well traveled as some, but I've spent quite a bit of time in a number of European countries and deal with Europeans regularly at work.

No work ethic, no innovation, insane regulatory hurdles, no avenues for entrepreneurs to get started, and most of their countries are essentially theme parks for Americans and Asians.  They're a collective group of people who are so soft that they don't care that a war of territorial aggression is happening on their doorstep. 

I'd bet against Europe in favor of America and southeast Asia in every way that I could. || Europoor? 

No thank you || US private equity eating up European stocks, but American retail investors think Coca-Cola and Costco are going to make them millionaires || Please keep saying this so I have more time to scoop up cheap European stocks. || Out of curiosity what are some of your other specific things that are interesting besides luxury? || People always say this here but like what specific regulations do you take issue with? Every time I see something about an EU regulation it always seems reasonable and understandable || Laughs in KOG. Easily my top earner. || ASML is a very solid play and seems particularly attractive after recent crash. Think its a very strong long term hold just waiting till when the bleeding stops since its flirting with the 600 buck mark recently. || You can buy ADRs are most every broker. 

You can buy over the counter European stocks on Fidelity I do it all the time. || Really does Robinhood, Schwab and others not offer European stocks? Seems like quite a big miss || Love your ""non gambling portfolio."" lots of blue chip stocks and completely missed the benefit UBS would get for taking over CS for peanuts.

Roche could be interesting especially with their expected entry into GLP. || I've followed a similar strategy of investing into specific stocks eschewing any indexes. Which is weird since most Americans invest directly into major US indexes and do well generally.

Which is clearly not the winning strategy for Europe with all major indexes lagging their US counterparts. || I have a love hate relationship with VW. Everytime I look at it thinking damn seems at a very attractive price point only to realise it'll look even more attractive the week after.. || Ehh, Europe's economy is mature and ... stagnant, in my view.

Higher dividend yields, much less growth and volatility than US. Growth industries like tech just isn't nearly as aggressive or well represented.

I've kept diversified overseas positions for safety for a long time, including Euro zone. Europe def tends to underperform for overall appreciation, especially after you factor in dividend witholding taxes with countries like France and Switzerland.

I largely view it as as a mitigation for risks of US markets (which is bulk of my portfolio) imploding or self-destructing. Very low expectations of outperformance in a bull market. || maybe I am stupid but these might be the worst charts I've ever seen || Very interesting chart would never in 10 guesses have picked Denmark, New Zealand and Australia as the top 3 best performing markets for last 2 decades. || Correction: ~~Open~~ broken immigration policies. Ph.D. scholars cannot get a visa, but arrive on a boat, and you get a free house and a monthly salary! I am all for humanitarian aid, but they really need to fix policy loopholes around this thing.

Ask any american trying to get work visa in Europe. || How does having open immigration policy have a negative impact on stock returns? || We do have an immigration problem, but of all the issues this is not one that hugely affects stock returns || Yep just feels wrong to be completely all in, into one single market. Never heard of ESIN, they seem to be beating the S&P last year. Def worth digging further thanks! || What did they ban or make illegal last time? || Don't you think Europe will counter-tariff the US as well? It's not a one way street. It's not like the US just tariffs the global market out of competing in the US and then nothing happens to US exports. || >I am not as well traveled as some

To the surprise of no one || I mean they are cheap for a reason, it's not like you discovered infinite money glitch. 

Sadly I'm saying that as European, I wish our markets were as strong as American but that's the way things are, unless we find a way to unite the economies and languages of all EU countries, we'll stay weak and divided. The risk aversion and fiscal austerity don't help either || Sometimes things are cheap for a reason. || That's like saying you'd rather have a bunch of beaters instead of a Ferrari. || More time? They’ve been cheap for 100 years, and rightly so. || Evolution is something I've pondered. Société des Bains de Mer as a potential buy/hold that is probably not going to be a home run but is an interesting company with fantastic assets that few have ever heard of. ASML. Exor is a kinda/sorta/maybe. || I am waiting for the day when EU can say FU to US about any sanctions, sale bans, tarrifs, which US randomly decides to slap on foreign companies. This one, [ASML, ](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ASML:NASDAQ?window=1Y)a heavyweight in Eurostoxx index, is down because it cannot sell to China, as per US orders. 

Also, waiting for the day when people can open a bank account in Europe without filling a form about U.S. stuff. It's quite funny that a Korean person (or take any nationality / residence), must fill FATCA forms to open a bank account in Europe. *Why is this 'scheme' not reciprocal?* Not advocating any taz evasion, but I don't know a single other example where a foreign country mandates a blanket rule on the financial system worldwide.

Also, waiting for a day when a European small/mid-cap(under $1B) can grow to become $100B in five years. The environment is far too communist or 'sabotagey' here. No sizeable VC support to speak of. And, from what I can see, it's all century-old, old wealth ruling the business climate. 

Until then, it's S&P-500 and Nasdaq-100 for me. You've an exposure to all markets automatically, because these companies operate globally. || Saab makes the things that make American weapons go boom. || Unrelated to investing but the 'do you want to accept cookies' makes everyone's life worse. I get the intention, but its the worst implementation I could envision. I'm pro-EU, but often it seems like they arrogantly want to collect rent checks on American innovation. || Communism seemed reasonable and understandable to the people that supported it too until they found out they were starving to death || Of course they do. Whoever is saying they don’t is incorrect || European companies don’t like listing in America because of the extra expense and the extra regulation. || I'm guessing the reason for RH would be that payment for order flow is illegal, at least in my country. || ""8% in Airbus because fuck Boeing.""

Hell yeah, brother! || Yea haven’t been able to pull the trigger on VW. I like BMW the most of the group  || Definitely better ways to visualise the data but the annualised returns at the bottom is fairly intuitive imo || Excellent distinction. Americans consider Europe “open” because they seemingly take no action in stopping the illegal immigration. || It doesn't he is just pushing rightwing talking points. || I'm German and experience this on a daily basis and it is often discussed in the German finance subreddits. It has an impact like this: There are more and more people who rely on welfare (Bürgergeld) and you have an increasing amount of people who aren't German (immigrants) who get Bürgergeld. In order to pay the Bürgergeld, you need taxes. Germany already has extremely high taxes. Taxes will be increased in the next year again. People who earn a lot, are fed up with this. They wander off to other countries like the US. So are a lot of companies. || You could write a 1,000 page dissertation on pros/cons of immigration but in general the govt has to spend money to provide services on people. Poor/uneducated people are net receivers (receive more benefits than they pay in taxes). This draws money out of the government that could be used to elsewhere, like subsidies on semiconductors (like here in the US) || They're all inter-related. On a super simple basis - More immigrants = larger gov't needed = stricter regulation of domestic companies (someone has to pay for all the social programs). Overcrowding also drags down the school systems leading to less innovation. || ESIN is just a newer ETF but it replicates the MSCI Europe Industrials 20/35 Capped Index, which is way older. It's done a lot better than most other European stock indices past decade and is centered around what Europe has done best: indsutrials.

Good luck. || Oh I'm sure they will, but they also have more to lose so either way, in that situation, it's still not the place to be. I would want to buy Europe into an acceleration which were likely to get with the next Democrat or even when it looks like the next Democrat is coming. That could come potentially as early as the midterms in 2026. Europe and 2025, it's just not exciting. Maybe when we see some technical bottoming patterns you could begin to look but there's so much heat in all of these assets going up. That's where the money is chasing. Bitcoin is closing in on 100k, tech has reset. In fact there is one European company I own now that you mention it, ASML, after that correction, this is a pretty good price. That company is very unique though, no one can do what they do. Without them, all the American companies like Nvidia, even Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, all that stuff doesn't exist || ""it's not like you discovered infinite money glitch.""

I didn't? 

Oh well, back betting on horse races! || Our markets aren't strong?

Novo Nordisk was already a world leader when obesity started in the 2000s before the US and if paid attention could have made you a lot of money. No US firm comes close. ASML. And so many others. 

European markets offer so many more structured products, a wider variety of stocks. The ability to invest in the US, China and the Middle East. || Ferraris are made in …


Europe!  || You don't know what you're talking about.  
  
Germany was the top performing developed market in 2003, 2006, and 2012.  Germany outperformed the U.S. in those years. 

Same for Switzerland in 2000.

In 2017, the U.S. was outperformed by the Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. || Never knew about this Monaco company that has basically provided S&P like returns over the past 5 years. Seems like growth over past few quarters has slowed down though, do you see that changing in the future? || The thing is there is an ever increasing amount of VC support but the best European companies still at late stage prefer to scale to the US due to higher valuations. Spotify is the prime example, founded in Sweden but founder took the business to the US at the first opportunity and listed in NYSE. So even the best and brightest European tech companies want to leave their domestic markets and enter US with European VCs encouraging this due to better scope of returns.

There just aren't as many buyers willing to pay a premium for the best companies in Europe to the extent that the US investors and markets can. Not sure if this is to do with US having higher risk appetite or easier access to capital to scale faster. || ASML acquired an American company to help develop EUV, part of the sale agreement included export controls because it was considered sensitive technology. || But Europe still has some of the highest living standards on Earth? || Slovenia is on track to overtake the US in HDI next year lol || At least Robinhood does not, as per their own website (which apparently you aren't allowed to link to).

That's what, half of reddit already? || Mercedes Benz $MBG:DE can be a 3x trade story if the stars align and the sentiment keeps positive. I've been monitoring to confirm a bullish reversal. || You’re way behind if you think that’s still right wing talk. Take a look at r/canada || Thinking the immigration in Europe is out of hand is rightwing?lol. Even the left acknowledged this by now, what are you then? || I understand the problems of immigration, I'm just saying that it doesn't hugely affect stock returns like other issues do. Why not talk about the crazy prices of energy? 3x the price of the US and China for electricity and 5x for gas. This plays a HUGE factor, because in the end everything is energy. The fact that the business climate is getting worse and worse in Europe. From really heavy regulations, to really high taxes. All talent is leaving Europe because high income and wealth taxes. Where China and the US give companies money to reduce carbon, EU fines companies that don't. People in Europe work less every year, we're the least working countries in the world, where the average workweek is way lower than the US or China while at the same time we have way more vacation. I mean, I can keep going on about strict climate policies, uncertain political movements to lack of investments in r&d, but the point is there are a LOT of issues that have way more impact than immigration. || I'm not so sure on that. The US losing its biggest trading partner (and vice versa) doesn't bode well for any party involved. To be honest, I don't think it will happen. I think we'll see some random tariffs on European steel and luxury goods, and then the EU will issue some counter-tariffs on that. The US and EU are way too intertwined economically for a trade war to do any party any good what so ever. 

EU needs US tech. US needs European advanced industrial technology. ASML is just one example of many European companies who provide industrial services and technology to global corporations, the US included. Only other real competitor in this space is Japan. High-end steel used in automotive applications and as tool steel for all types of industry molds and dies come from mainly European companies or Japanese companies. Industrial robotics mainly come from Swedish/Swiss, German or Japanese companies. Germany is huge in the chemical industry. Germany is huge in the industrial optics industry. Sweden (where I am from) is big in the general engineering industry and mining industry with the likes of Volvo Group (world's largest semi-truck company), SKF (world's largest advanced bearing company), Atlas Copco (general engineering) and Sandvik (mining and industry tooling) . And there are many more examples. 

I am not saying the US can't function without Europe or vice versa (like some people are), but I am saying that we are way too interconnected to have stupid trade-wars weighing us down in an already unstable world. We are our most important allies and the one thing Russia/China and the others want more than anything is for us to stop being such good friends. Why should we give them this? There aren't many things more stupid in geopolitics than infighting between the EU and the US. 

Well well, I guess my rant has been more about actual economics and geopolitics than the stock market. Deep down, we all know the stock market is not as grounded in national and international economics as some people think it is. The stock market is more interested in profits and dividends, whereas our actual economies benefit more from job creation than it does from pure profits. 

Just providing a different perspective on this whole thing. The stock market isn't as representative of actual economics as some people think. || so on which ""horses"" are you betting? || No no they are not lol. || Too bad shitty investments and economies are made there too! || Those are single points in time and don't mean much, if anything.

Do this:

Germany vs the US from 2000-present

Switzerland vs the US from 2000-present || Cool I’ll keep my 40% annualised gains in mag 7 thanks, enjoy being poor though || bro, it's 2B maket cap with daily volume of 386 shares ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face) Just saying, before you YoLo on this one, there're also Hilton and Marriots. || I can see a path for higher growth but I think for me that's a really an instance of something that I see as a ""buy, put away and forget about"" name with some crown jewel assets, including the famed Casino De Monte Carlo (https://www.montecarlosbm.com/en/casino-monaco/casino-monte-carlo)

  Also, it has a *tiny* float of around 3m shares. Last I checked, the government of Monaco owns more than half the shares and there's a number of other investors - LVMH owns around 5% too, for example.

""Never knew about this Monaco company ""

Yeah, it's something I've rarely ever seen mentioned (someone's long article on the stock from 2022 - https://www.undervalued-shares.com/weekly-dispatches/bains-mer-monaco-a-surprise-coup-for-monacos-casino-company) || I just looked up European stocks on Robinhood and I can buy shares of them right now || Porsche || Immigration levels are way higher in the US and Canada. So if it has anything to do with stocks following your logic it should be good for stocks. || r/canada is a right wing subreddit you didn't seriously just say that lol || It is a rightwing talking point what has nothing to do with stocks. So go to a political sub to spew it || Those issues - especially energy - would be more priced in. || Where would the money flow in either situation? Let's say it goes bad. Lots of tariffs and a trade war. It's not good for either economy but it's especially bad for Europe. 

Let's say it goes less bad and it's a trade negotiation, it's great for America and still a little bit bad for Europe 

There are trillions of dollars out there and they aren't going to be parking it in India so it's either equities, bonds of various countries, but bonds are less attractive when inflation is still a concern, if we went into a demand destruction deflationary environment bonds would probably work pretty well, especially American treasuries. But that's the thing, the money has to go somewhere and pretty much at every juncture there's no real argument to choose Europe over America because in any one of these scenarios they are going to do less good. Specific companies like ASML are different because they have an edge. They are not replaceable. If some of these European companies start to build more factories in America and play along, it's still going to hurt their profitability in the short run and that might be your buying opportunity in anticipation of Democrats getting back in office. It's a long play though || The cheap ones || Mag 7 (which I also own) with slowing growth, meanwhile I got 100% gains in 6-12 months in European small cap construction and mining. There are levels to this game || They are called Europoors for a reason lmao || UK & US immigration rates are actually nearly identical. Germany's is significantly the highest. 

Western immigrants are (generally) wealthier and more educated compared to European's. USA specifically also spends much less per citizen on social programs. Less draining on the system. || I have a hard time believing that. 'Right wing' compared to the rest of reddit?... that's middle. maybe. || A trade war occurs and if your richest can't go on European holidays anymore without paying $2000 visas - US tariffs disappear that same evening. || I get what you are talking about. You are talking about financial markets and the US' financial power. And I 100% agree with you that the US is the world leader in financial markets and a lot of equity, bonds and other securities investments go to the US because of that. 

What I am talking about is economics. Did you know that the EU exports $400bn yearly to the US, while the US exports ""only"" $230bn to the EU? 

A tariff situation would be horrible for both parties because:

1. The EU makes a lot of money from exporting to the US and obviously does not want to lose that. Losing too much of that would be deflationary (as demand would drop significantly). And no one wants deflation. 

2. The US obviously needs a lot of what it's buying from the EU, and making it more expensive is going to drive up the cost to the end consumer, contributing to inflation in the process. 

Did you know that the US' imports of European goods is almost as large as its imports of Chinese goods? $400bn vs $500bn. Despite what you hear in the US with stuff like ""oh we buy everything from China, we are so dependent on China"" and so on. You are almost just as dependent on the EU. The difference is, it is products you as and end consumer do not see as much. They are mostly in the industries that produce your goods.

It's almost as if we live in a global economy where trade happens between everyone, which is also largely the reason why we can have such diverse and successful economies - where countries who do not have a certain natural resource, can buy it from another country, in order to manufacture something that some other country wants. And so on. Japan's economy is a perfect example of this. 

The US pioneered the modern global economy, and now it threatens to leave it. It is absurd to me. Again, the absurdity of this is why, again, my guess is that we will not see this actually happening. It would hurt both parties and I think the only tariffs that will come out of this is one's issued because of emotional sake. A ""look, I did what I said I would"", type of thing. But that's just my guess. 

Anyway, it seems like we are interested in talking about two different things so I guess we won't get that much further with this conversation. || Germany is place 53 on cia factbook Us 38 united Kingdom 39. Biggest group of Immigrants in Europe are Western imigrants from Eastern Europe. || You can believe what you want, makes no difference to me. But it's quite right wing. || Isn't the goal to position yourself to make money?

"Target shares plunge 20% after discounter cuts forecast, posts biggest earnings miss in two years","[Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/) on Wednesday missed Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and posted only a slight uptick in customer traffic, despite the discounter’s price cuts on thousands of items and its early holiday sale. 

The big-box retailer reversed course and cut its full-year profit guidance, just three months after [hiking that forecast](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.htm). It said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.30 to $8.90. That’s [lower than the $9 to $9.70 per share range](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.html) that it shared in August and below the $9.55 a share expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Target now expects fourth-quarter comparable sales to be approximately flat. That metric, which is also known as same-store sales, includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months. 

Target fell short of Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate by 20%, its biggest miss in two years. It also marked its first revenue miss since August 2023. 

The company’s shares plunged 20% in morning trading.",SFkitty94122,2024-11-20 20:27:41,652,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvrcw8/target_shares_plunge_20_after_discounter_cuts/,None,"20% is kind of wild for a company like Target. It's also wild to hike guidance in the previous quarter and then downgrade the next. It will be interesting to see how the holiday numbers end up for a lot of these retail stores.

On a side note, it seems like everywhere I go in person now a days there's no staff or I have a lot trouble finding people if I need help. Seems like Target is always empty with no cashiers. Went to Barnes and Noble two days ago and spent 20 minutes trying to find a book because I couldn't find someone to help me. Feels like it's easier to just order shit off Amazon instead of going in person to these stores and waste an hour of my time. || Combining this with the Walmart earnings report it looks like consumers are pulling back spending. Not a great start to the holiday season. 

We’ll get Costco earnings on 12/12 so at least some mid holiday season info.

Edit: Amazon earnings in January. Would be interesting to see if they’re getting a boost given the low prices and time saving. || I just bought at $122. I still see my wife making a lot of purchases at Target. My wife's' buying trends has never failed me before. || Target has always baffled me as a consumer. Its sits in a space that makes no sense. Its trying to sell cheap stuff at slightly higher prices by pretending its slightly better than stuff you find at Walmart, Amazon or anywhere else. But the reality is its the same stuff.

I think the key to Target has always been convenience. I need something today, and if Target is closer than Walmart, they win, because $1 saving isnt worth it. But thats it... if Walmart is closer, then they win. If I can wait a day, then Amazon wins.

On top of that they dont have a unique item to draw me in. A ""loss leader"" if you will. When they expanded the food court, I thought that they were doing just that but they totally half ar$ed the food court. What a missed opportunity that was.

Their hot dogs suck. The other food (pizza hut crap?) is overpriced and not fresh. I mean... if you want me to bring my kids for a bite to eat and then have me shop there, you need to do a lot better. This is how Costco does it. I go there far more often because of the stupid food court, gas and $5 chicken. I save $2 just to go on and spend $200 inside... Target already has the infrastructure to do it. Just up your quality, discount the hot food, and draw people in. How do you mess this up? People will naturally buy other things while there for convenience. || Anecdotal, but I was in a store in West San Jose recently and the underwear/socks were locked up in security cases, and 3 employees I talked to didn't speak a word of English. Hard to differentiate yourself from Walmart when you're like this. || Nice little discount on a good stock || Part of the problem has to be that Target seems unable to manage it's supply chain to keep it's shelves stocked. It's like winning the lottery of I actually find 1% milk in stock. Went shopping last Saturday afternoon and the yogurt shelves were mostly empty. I don't know why Target can't keep groceries in stock. || It's almost like Target were able to pretend that organized theft rings were responsible for falling sales for only so long.  

When the likes of Costco and Walmart are doing well if not stealing your customers for 2 consecutive years, you have a problem. || Wow, sounds like they really missed their Targets! || Targets near me are terrible especially in terms of customer service. A lot of fucking items including soap, toothpaste, and laundry detergent is locked up in a glass case and no one shows up when you ring the damn bell. It’s so bad that I started going to Walmart, which was surprisingly better. || Man I love target too. Much better vibes and atmosphere then Walmart so this is kind of disappointing, but I mean things are expensive

Edit: why did Walmart have more success then target though? || Target has been going downhill for years, I get K-mart vibes when I go in there || When are people going to realize that TGT is mismanaged, has a product mix that is inconsistent with today's consumer, has no new ideas for turnaround and seems to be hell bent to follow the Kmart plan to irrelevance.
Investors outta be picketing HQ and demanding real top down changes.
I'm sorry for the employees who are overworked and short-staffed. || Holy moly it’s mega down || How is WMT doing so well and TGT is stumbling? Isn't TGT supposed to cater to a more affluent customer base? || Walmart doing great, because it has become a one point stop for folks even with high incomes... The point of high income is preservation of capital. Target was sent packing from Canada when their stores were empty, or limited staff, and Canadians, whom value time and daylight, kicked it out. We can do Costco, WMT, Costco + WMT, WMT + Loblaws, or just WMT. but Target always forced you to go somewhere else, losing especially time. || is this an early recession indicator? || did you know that TJ Maxx is twice the market cap of Target!! It just shows you how poorly tgt has done for its shareholders. Maybe this is a wakeup call but I doubt it || Dropping my $.02 here, my Target and Walmart are on different sides of the same street. I've started going to Walmart more when I know what I want, since they have a dozen working self checkout stations. The Target on the other hand since Covid has had only 4 self checkouts with 1 of them broken almost every time, and a line to use those self checkouts. And then they only have one person actually operating a register.

Not sure if other people have had this experience, but the gamble of having to wait 20 minutes for self checkout versus zero wait at Walmart has swayed me more than any other factor. || They only have themselves to blame. The last few times I've gone there for something specific they've been out of it, plus they've been locking up more and more product. Rather than driving to Target for something I need only to leave empty handed, or getting annoyed that I have to wait for someone to unlock a display case, I've just started ordering those items from Amazon.

Since I usually picked up a couple other random impulse items during my Target runs, that's even more money that they're losing. || They went from training three-letter agencies to locking tide and bleach behind access points while reducing total staff

Why the fuck did I not short them  || “Hot take”: Inflation rearing its head finally

I’m wondering if Walmart is the winner here bc of perceived low cost. Obvi Walmart had nice earnings wonder what’s behind the juxtaposition. || Thanks, I hate it. Been holding since the last 20% bloodbath in 2022. I lost a lot of money back then and it looks like things haven't improved at all.  
  
For as long as I can remember the dominance of Amazon and Walmart has been a shadow hanging over Target's head. Nobody gave it a chance in the era of e-commerce and wrote it off as the next Sears. Despite all odds it found a way to survive, even thrive. That's why I held on for so long, because I assumed they would figure it out like they always had.

I'm not sure if they can do it anymore. Management is terrible at their jobs and blames everything but themselves for poor performance. Their main advantage over Walmart, the shopping experience, is completely countered by Walmart+. Where do they go from here? || Target has so many challenges. What should be even more alarming is that last year, they were hit with terrible foot traffic reduction because of the boycott - and also safety concerns in stores - the fact that Q2 underperformed I’m sure was shocking internally. When discretionary spending took a back burner to essentials, they lost ground to Walmart. Walmart is a literal one stop shop. Target is fun but is not a grocery store for most Americans. And Walmart has gained ground with more affluent shoppers. Which, ironically, Target has abandoned those people in hopes to bring in a value guest. But their focus on value is so dramatic  and it’s only rooted in poorly constructed private label. It’s almost as if they’ve eliminated a lot of mainstream brands in lieu of their own. I think they’ve lost their way and no longer have an Identity. And Walmart is making genuine strides in technology, supply chain and infrastructure while Target seems to be a step behind. I think they’re going to need a leader change sooner than later to get back on track. || Im guessing walmart is eating into their customer base, honestly feels like Walmart has improved closer to Target’s quality if not better but retain lower prices. || Time to buy low? || I'm surprised to not see this mentioned, but maybe a year ago or more Target re-designed their online business to include third-party sellers. So when you search their app for something, a bunch of bullshit results get returned. You can filter it out to see only stuff sold by Target, but it's annoying and makes the experience really terrible. When I do find what I'm looking for that's sold and shipped by Target, it's more expensive than Amazon. Also, where I live, buying stuff spontaneously at Target sucks because the prices on the website are cheaper. They will price match at the register, but it's pain and I hate wondering if I'm overpaying for stuff in store. I just buy stuff on Amazon and Walmart+ now. Every once in awhile, Target will have a crazy sale on something, but that's the extend of what I buy there now. || Walmart had a huge beat. Could Target’s issues be specific to Target? I know they shot themselves in the foot wading into social issues, could we still be seeing some of that? Could corporate governance be at fault? || This is wild. I wonder what's going on inside the company. || Target is basically a more expensive, cleaner Kmart. Walmart still has them absolutely demolished in terms of volume, pricing and inventory variety. Some even compete on cleanliness (new ones, for the first 5-10 years after that they tend to look like Kmarts during bankruptcy) || They went from training three-letter agencies to locking tide and bleach behind access points while reducing total staff

Why did I not short them  || Target is for people who either (1) are rich (2) think they’re rich (3) not careful with money even though they know they’re not rich or (4) don’t feel like being in the vicinity of typical Walmart shoppers.

Kind of an interesting niche for retail but they have customers.  -20% is an insane knee jerk reaction and I would be very surprised if it doesn’t recoup at least half what it lost today in the next couple weeks. || Damn. I am using Target instead of bend-the-knee Bezos’s Amazon. They have s lot of the same stuff & ship it right to you. || Target fucked up going curbside and actively driving people out of the stores. It fucked up actively preventing people from wandering, from impulse buying and from having the happy mental connection of ""going to Target"". There is a reason Costco don't fuck around with curbside. Target abandoned it's store to chase low margins with zero upside. You go into stores no and it is just a sad red Walmart. No variety nothing to look at, no effort, no inspiration or attempt to make me wander and shop, empty aisles and shelves. I have zero reason to chose Target over Walmart now when before there was an illusion of more upscale experience at a comparable price. || Inventory up 30% on sales flat. What are they doing? Going to put lots of pressure on margin in coming quarters || I think I should invest || Price gouging chickens come home to roost. || Who goes into a Target, their online store is Prehistoric.  They are no longer relevant, Target had class when people started to use Walmart instead of K-Mart for jokes.  Now what do they have, lame commercials.  I'm so glad I read Sams book stopped me from buying Target stock.  Target is Sears and the armpit of Macys mixed together. || Target has no moat and doesn’t really specialize in anything. Probably time for cost cutting to remain competitive. || Never understood the comparison between Target and Walmart. Apple and oranges. || [deleted] || Uh oh. || Looks like the higher interest rates are finally shrinking spending and affecting profits.  I bet more people will put Christmas on their credit card.  Visa might be a good buy here. || I almost always think this is just a way to buy at a cheaper price that they manipulated. || Sold it post election..  that worked out.. 20% gain.    balances out also selling disney at the same time.. || That’s ironic || As a Canadian, I could tell you folks, walked in out Canadian store and made a grimace. THIS is good?  In 2015, at 0% interest rates, Target closed all 133 stores. And Canadians are atrociously bad financial planners, but value one thing- time, due to climate, shorter daylight hours in winter. So having to wait in a Target to pay x more was a No no for $$ but Time far worst, or not finding what you want and be compelled to detour by Walmart.... So if Canadians, whom are not good with money actually, outvoted Target in 2015, that should signal why Americans will do the same in 2024, and they are far savvier with $$$. || Target is a discounter? Huh. || I think the bigger issue is that Walmart has really ramp up their online sales to a point where it is now respectable, in this regard Target is slipping big time. || Might not be a bad time to buy some LEAPs. || I always thought of target and Walmart as a reflection of the actual economy. Could mean a huge drop in spending and mark of a beginning of a recession. || I used to shop at Target so I don't have to go into Walmart but now Walmart offers Walmart plus so I don't mind using them. If shit is being delivered, I am buying from the vendor at the lowest price. Box of crayons from Walmart or target makes no difference to me || What bothers me about the last few visits to Target is how hard it is to find simple, basic items. Everything has been over designed, over styled and over priced. I wanted an empty spray bottle… the closest thing I could find was a a weird $15 cleaning system which had a spray bottle and some other stuff I didn’t need. They used to sell packages of multiple  sponge make up wedges for $2-$3 .. the only ones I could locate were single,large and $6 that looked like they were styled for Instagram. I see less of familiar national brands or Target’s discount versions and way more boutique brands. I love nice design and pretty things but I can’t afford to pay extra on every day consumables just to feel fancy. || Target has the only low sugar grape jelly. But I don’t like putting my groceries up on their returns counter rather than a conveyor belt like they used have twenty years ago. Well, they still have them but only staff one of them if you’re lucky. || Since when is target a discounter? They always sell shit at full price. Even Walmart is not a discounter.  Family tree or family dollar are. || Black Friday sale came early not picking up Target on clear over reaction is obvious mistake || Is buying Target stock a value buy? Or stay away? || target || I can't imagine buying Target stock.  It's not 2004.  They lock everything up now in the stores and sell woke clothing.  Also, curbside pushes people out of the store. || The miss on earnings and lowered guidance definitely caught investors off guard. It'll be interesting to see how they adjust for the rest of the year. || Picked up 10k worth this morning. Give it some time it'll bounce back || I only go there for the occasional grocery item. Most of the stuff in Target like their cloths are crap, and their furniture it ultra low grade particle board shit. || Wow so my wife shopping at target for 5 hours didn't help them lol || ughh it's the poor people stealing shit! that's why we can't meet our forecasted numbers /s || I love and prefer target. The clientele is better, the lines are better, the store is smaller.

I’m a buyer at $121.

I also support their LGBTQIA 🏳️‍🌈 apparel || What you gonna do when TikTok shop comes for you? 

$TGT DUMP. || what was the amount of shares shorted last quarter and this quarter....someone made money || Well, it’s been pretty overvalued for a while and pricing in many of the same growth metric’s other onlineERs and comparables || It’s a goddamned retailer. || Maybe stop locking up all the products and closing self checkout. I just use Amazon more now || Did pelosi’s husband sell off their target shares yesterday? || Ppl are priming stuff to their house as they drive by target regularly || And the majority of that store comes from China, I want to make some witty comment about their future but it's not really coming to me 😂☠️ || Bought 100 shares at 121.36 then sold at 121.40

  
I have no problem with their politics but sadly I think this affects their sales, not worth the risk in my mind with trump presidency. Could be a war on target brewing. || Target stores are giant shitholes.

- Messy isles. 
- Shelves in disarray.
- Understaffed & poor customer service.
- Everything seemingly under lock & key.
- Exorbitant pricing. 
- Minimal checkouts available.

The stock deserves to get hammered. This CEO has been getting away with mismanaging the brand for way too long. || [removed] || Dollar General for the win. I despise target for their crap covid policies, their pro theft policies, and they can reap what they sow. || Yeah customer service feels like it was put on life support 10 years ago and COVID killed it. Vicious cycle of companies not being able to pay well and offer low prices, so more stuff moving online, which kills, jobs and rinse and repeat.

 I still find good deals when Im in smaller cities but in the major city I live, amazon is almost always cheaper than our local target because nobody will work there for less than $20 hr (which is fair because thats what you need to survive). || Customer service is in the toilet. I appreciate places like Costco for actually being fully staffed. I went to Michaels for the first time in a year. No cashiers, all self checkout. But there was not a single attendant like every other store. Won't be going back. Target is hit or miss. Usually mine is well staffed, but random days they have like nobody working and lines are halfway through the store. || When I hear about people being mad at inflation honestly Target is what comes to mind. It really seems like they have just rounded up prices to the nearest ten regardless of product. Deodorant? $10 for a stick. Shampoo? $20. || Pretty nasty feedback loop. Staff is cut because people buy online more. In-store customers start buying online because of a lack of customer service. || RE your first comment, the 20% drop makes more sense with that shifting guidance narrative. Makes it seem like leadership isn't quite sure what they are doing. || Tgt csuite needs to be fired.  All of them.  These clowns do this shit every few quarters.  They have no clue whats going on at their stores.  It's time to clean house.  Every 3qrts they dp this shit and the stock drops 20+ percent points.  It's pathetic || I took so much hate for saying Target executives can’t be trusted.

Previouly, they pretended supply chain was why they had shitty corporate performance.  

Next debacle they blamed on weather.

Then they had a good run of covering up their incompetence with lies about shoplifting.  This deceit was interesting, because unlike vague claims on weather and supply, there were facts that could objectively show how dishonest they were being.

Facts like the shrink values were not that huge, and that the real losses were because of terrible executive strategy on product mix and inventory mismanagement.  Facts like how they presented shrink as if it meant only shoplifting, when in fact shoplifting was only a small component of shrink, and that much bigger components were their terrrible operational leadership enabling tons of friendly fraud and inventory mismanagement, plus bad executive decisions on packaging and shipping and storage.  

It’s facts like how all their excuses blaming shoplifting were trumpeted loudly by their PR department (which isn’t under oath and isn’t subject to SEC prosecution) while they were judiciously restrained in using that false excuse in the mandatory filings for which they could be prosecuted or sanction for misrepresentation.

It’s facts like how peers such as Walmart have thrived as Target has flopped, even though they have the same markets, the same customers, the same business model.

Target has also distinguished themselves with poor people management.

Target’s executives can’t be trusted. || Yeah they basically feel like walmarts nowadays || I work at Target (not going to say which one) so let me explain why it appears there's no staff. Because there isn't any. One store out in the middle of nowhere proved it could operate on a skeleton crew so corporate took that to mean **ALL** stores could operate on a skeleton crew, so they slashed everyone's hours and only have the bare minimum number of staff at any given point (true story). They don't have more than 2 cashiers because they fully expect everyone else in the store to just drop what they're doing and run to the registers if the line gets long. You have trouble finding people when you need help because there's only 2 of us in the hardlines section of the store and we're both in the back room trying get our pulls (items in the back that need to go to the floor) to a certain percentage by the end of the night or we get in big trouble (corporate sees the percentage so when we don't hit it they know but when a disgruntled customer has a bad experience that usually only goes as far as local management who cares more about what corporate thinks than your experience), which is something we can struggle to do if we're constantly having to run out to the sales floor to help people and is made worse by the fact that they send the electronics person home around 6 meaning we also have to cover the electronics section (something none of us are trained for). Which means that when someone asks for help it really disrupts our work and can potentially screw us over for the night, which is also why when you do find someone to help you they are often not as helpful as you'd like. And I'd like to point out it's not even a matter of not enough profits, we can see how much money our store makes every day, we make significantly more in 1 day than it would take to give every employee 40 hours a week (and not every employee wants 40 hours), sure there are costs we aren't seeing but I seriously doubt that their profit margins are so narrow that they cant up the hours and properly staff the store. || Same can be said about raley's, Safeway, best buy, all skeleton crews. Layoffs. Minimal hours, slow sales. It's all coming to a head probably. Let's see what more tariffs in 2025 bring! || How do you manage to fuck up guidance this badly

These are not serious people || Now that Target has everything I ever need locked behind glass or in cages, and it’s impossible to find someone to open anything, I usually avoid going there. || For what its worth, I went to walmart to pick up spme meds and they are back to fully-staffed checkouts. Probably 12+ open registers. I noticed. || I was in target twice this past week, 5 days apart. I saw two half-full drink containers on a shelf the first time. They hadn’t moved an inch when I came back. || Our target is in kinda a ghetto area but it's filthy and never has any cashiers or lanes open. If I wanted that shopping experience I'd save 5% and hit up Walmart. || My target has like 4 self check lanes and 20 cashier lanes and only staff 1 of them. They gotta pick what they want to do. Either staff them or get more fucking self check because waiting 15 minutes for either is insane. || I literally spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon just so I don’t have to go into a store. || Complete opposite of a place like Sephora! || I went to the bay area and few weeks ago and I needed a toothbrush and some deodorant so I went to walgreens. Never again. Everything is locked behind glass, even the the $2 toothbrush i got. Good luck if you need more than one thing because one guy was running around the entire store opening the glass for people to get stuff. I get why people order from Amazon soo much. Idk if it's similar in Walmart or Target but I can only oy imagine. || What does this say about the rest of the economy || Haha you’re just realizing in 2024 that Amazon has taken over retail because it’s easier and cheaper? || They get scheduled by a stupid algorithm. || I went yesterday to buy a new phone charger at Walmart. Of course it was locked up and I had to wait 10 mins before an employee hurriedly walked by. When I got his attention I could see his eyes roll to the back of his head that I caught him. The entire time he was checking me out I could feel his utter contempt barely disguised. || I'm looking forward to some great black Friday sales || Costco executives have traditionally been amazingly candid on industry realities, telling truths that we never, ever hear elsewhere.

I listen to then to get the real truth on transportation costs and trends, same with commodities and consumers.

It’s little known, but Costco isn’t actually a grocery business.  It’s a subscription business model.

As a result, Costco does cost-plus model for groceries.  So if beef is up 15% at Costco, then I know for a fact that’s a true reflection of beef inflation, not corporate gouging at work.  Costco executives will often say “eggs will be up 8% this quarter, but supply is already back on stream and will be lower next Q”. || i thought the Walmart earnings beat? || I've been spending more of my money at Costco as I prepare for potential inflation due to tariffs and mass deportations. My thinking is that I might as well stock up on household items that will last for awhile and Costco is the best place to do that. || > Combining this with the Walmart earnings report it looks like consumers are pulling back spending. Not a great start to the holiday season.  

It was when Target's hand got forced and we witnessed them doing multiple rounds of price cuts on top of folks who work in liquidation reporting that Target was dumping their unsold inventory onto them you knew inflation was falling fast. And you knew that Target whining about retail theft was just them blowing smoke up our asses when Walmart themselves reported they were gaining higher networth customers, i.e. Target's prime base. We didn't need to wait for the next CPI report to realize what was going on.  

Turns out Walmart and Costco managed inflationary pressures and pivoted in raising and then lowering prices masterfully. || As a high income consumer who has Walmart, Costco, and Target equidistant to my house I strongly feel it’s because Target sucks. 


There is no reason to go to Target when Walmart and Costco have better selection and prices. This is a Target problem, not a consumer problem.  They offer no value over their competitors. I don’t even know why you’d go to Target other than if you’re afraid of mingling with the more diverse racial and economic clientele at Walmart and Costco. Target’s only selling point is it costs more so it keeps out the poors, which doesn’t seem like a very good business model. || Didn’t Target announce recently they’re cutting prices on a ton of items? Maybe they finally realized their inflated profits off raising prices can only last so long before people just abandon the store for good. || Cisco is always so god damned packed every time I go. Lines waiting to get chicken. Shoulder to shoulder walking outside of aisles. It’s a mad house. When I go to the huge target by my house there’s never any cashier lines open and only one half of the self checkouts open. Never busy || idk where you live but yesterday afternoon i counted 15 workers in my target, outside of the check out. My target is always packed with workers and spectrum people trying to sell me phones || It’s the eCommerce and last mile delivery. Walmart is killing it on that front || Costco will be interesting. Spending can be pulled back collectively, but a lot of consumers just switch buying habits or locations. Cost sensitivity might drive people through the door at a Costco rather than hurt it. You still need gas, $1.50 hot dogs, and toilet paper. || Arw they pulling back or shifting to temu and shein? || She have any other buying trends? || lol true. Mine too. Target, Sephora, Lulu, all still viable buys || My wife shops at  Target as her hobby. Looks like millennial women couldn't save it. || Buddy, smart money left target decades ago. It’s now in Costco and Amazon || As someone who used to work at Target corporate, I can tell you personally that their leadership and culture is straight ASS and they have no idea how to position the company. || Unique? Well they went all in on Trans and DEI in front of the store. Bold move that’s paying off one way or the other || If you hold up a Trump sign and they frown with disgust, you will probably see an unstaffed store in a few months time

EDIT: really? you guys dont like satires about future Trump policies? I mean you voted Trump to deport them didn't you? || Underrated comment || How is it a good stock? It’s a poorly run company || Not American but it's probably the worst shop I've ever been in in my life || Our small city size Target stores are terrible with inventory. I have a friend who jokes about writing his own app to post inventory checks on popular items like TP during his morning runs. || This has become incredibly frustrating for me. I very rarely go to Target and am able to buy everything on my shopping list. At least one of the things I want is almost always out of stock. || Sometimes there are problems with the supply chain but (at least at my store) we have so many pallets of product that just sits in the backroom, literally everywhere in the backroom because we don't have the space to put it anywhere or the staff to properly deal with it. That's why sometimes if you see online that it says we have a specific item the employee will still tell you we're out of stock, it's very likely buried in an unbroken pallet somewhere in the backroom and finding it and digging it out would take a lot of time (which we don't have because we've got 1000 other things to do before the end of our shift). I will say that sometimes the system is wrong and we genuinely don't have the item but very often we absolutely have it, but digging it out could easily take 20-30 minutes, you don't want to wait that long and I don't have 20-30 minutes to spare breaking open and digging through dozens of pallets. || This is hilarious! my Target is always packed with food, but most people o know don't shop there cause of prices; especially when aldi's is next store || It's the shoplifters, they're stealing all the yogurt.

edit: Guess it wasn't clear... /s || I can't see to find vanilla almond milk anywhere. || Yeah my town has a Walmart and Target across the street from each other. Target has a little bit of some things while Walmart has a lot of everything.

We did have two other grocery stores in town and the one I would go to recently closed, so the one remaining is a clusterfuck. Target and Walmart both have food sections, but Target is super limited while Walmart has full produce, meat, bakery, and as many shelves of food as you'd expect a typical grocery store - I just go there now because Walmart will also have literally anything else I may need, while target ""probably"" will but also ""probably"" won't.

Now, idk if this is the case with all Targets but the ones I've seen are just smaller, little more expensive, and less product versions of Walmart. The only convenience is it's usually way less busier and more organized. || Mine installed those locked cabinets in like half the store beginning of the year. Was such a pain in the ass. Not sure if a directive or just store manager. But they just leave them open lately. Probably not enough staff to respond to all the help buttons. || Nobody is smash and grabbing at Costco. But your point still remains with Walmart doing well. || Idk man I still think theft is bad. || >  and no one shows up when you ring the damn bell

Because there very likely isn't anyone **TO** show up, Targets all work on skeleton crews nowadays. || I don't get why that's surprising? Walmart always has better and more selection of products. Target is for people who are trying to pretend that they're better than they are. It's always been weird to me. Give me the store with more products and options any day. || I think people care more about their wallets than vibes and atmosphere  || > Edit: why did Walmart have more success then target though?  

Inflation which favored the company with better pricing power (Walmart's supply chain management is god tier) and private label brands. Walmart was much, much earlier to the game with private label brands like ""Great Value"" and even though Sam's Club isn't as dominant as Costco, just having that store around during covid years was a case of right place, right time. Costco and Sam's Club taught us that if you can convince enough people to pay an annual membership fee and arm twist your suppliers into providing bulk discounts, you can dominate during inflationary periods. || Walmart is where most Americans get their groceries and since they are already there, they will just buy stuff also. That's what I heard on the radio 2 days ago || Honestly the vibes at Target are no longer good. I’ve been a loyal customer of theirs for something like 15 years. The stores now are a shell of what they were 5 years ago. Stuff is out of stock. The place is super messy and disorganized. SO MANY CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR. The vibe sucks. And I go a lot less. || Walmart has succeeded in moving ""upscale"" a little. The clientele are much different than 2 years ago. They've also stepped up the quality of their basic clothes.  

At the same time I've noticed Target has cut staff and their basic clothes like t shirts and flannels have turned to shit. The one near me is a ghost town. They don't seem to clean it either. Reminds me of a Sears. || Target in the small city near me feels like a place that cater to middle class white people buying stuff they don’t really need.. Terrible grocery experience, overpriced hygiene products, small automotive and tool sections, shoe sections filled with shoes that would have been popular 10 years ago. 

It’s a place where wives go to spend their husbands money on random house trinkets and drink Starbucks and maybe pick up the snacks for the kids while you’re there. 

The Walmarts have trouble too but it’s  image based like the stereotype how trashy the people shop there and higher class people shop at target. And how bad the they butchered the 24/7 and self checkouts. 

Target has better service and cleanliness at the expense of less things and higher prices. 

Walmart has worse service but more things and they are usually cheaper. || yeah after it went up 80% in the last year.. || Walmart is a one stop shop that provides ‘great value’ for all brands. The one stop shop is important - when grocery and essentials have been prioritized over discretionary purchases. So Walmart is benefiting from that. However, Target was reliant on discretionary who also happened to have essentials and some grocery. Walmart wins. And now Target is making bad decisions to try and rush to the bottom abandoning their core consumer. I think they’ve lost their way. || Target is middle class

Costco is upper class

Walmart is working class

Middle class is the hardest to market to and most picky.  When times are good they swing to affluent, when times are bad they swing to working class.  Economy seems to be on the way down per US consumer. || Didnt walmart just beat earnings? TBH I dont follow this sector. || All the businesses with retail (or are themselves retail) that are locking merchandise up seem to not be doing well…. Target, CVS, Walgreens || Dude it used to be the complete opposite. I used to not wanna go to Walmart cuz there’d be 2 registers and 3 self checkouts going. Even in the weekday you’d have to wait a bit.

That said I have been super bull Walmart ever since I saw
That back a few years ago. Have about 275shares and some calls. Might pick up target today tho, this is quite low || A lot of people are broke. It's anecdotal but I have friends who used to stick their nose up at Walmart and would shop more at Target and grocers like publix shift over. The lower cost stores like Walmart, Aldi, and Costco (for bulk) are seeing heavier foot traffic then ever. || You don’t have to “wonder”, they literally post their same store sales growth monthly. || $5 bacon at target. || Excellent description. Target seems to have no idea what they’re doing. || Walmart has been stepping it up. Even Sam’s club is really good. I prefer it over Costco now. || I'm going with no due to looming inflation and people viewing Target as more of a Luxury store over Walmart. I actually sold a good chunk of my Target shares, thankfully, the other day because I saw it dropping over the next year. || Buy low, sell lower || Potentially, may be a play here. || Hell yeah. This is a great opportunity. I bet people in 3 years will be like what the hell was I doing not buying || Yep,  YoLo on it with options!


Sadly, my European broker, who is riding is too high on moral horse, concerned about its clients' financial well being, has banned options on TGT today. What an a-hole. || They dipped to the low 100s last year around October 23, which was a good buying opportunity.  I'm now in the red on my TGT holdings, but I'm planning on DCAing some shares.  They are also now close to a 4% yield. || The women that shop at Target look better than the women that shop at Walmart.

♥️ Target || Target is one of the first stores I shop at for an event thar I need an outfit fast. Their prices r great and it's pretty adorable. Their Wicked merch is all I'm living in right now. They need to either get rid of their grocery section or expand it. || They have one major advantage over Walmart: they operate in cities || ""I returned to a store a quarter of a century later, and it was different!"" || Picked up 10k worth at 127 per share, so far not looking good || 🙄 || I didn't even know Target had a woke reputation. || There’s always one person who feels the need to tell others about their political views lol. Literally nobody cares, buddy || > Go woke up, go broke

The phrase that keeps being repeated even though it has 0 predictive power.

Also ""slight uptick in customer traffic"" and $8.60 profit per share doesn't sound like going broke at all. || Correlation does not imply causation. || I work there and have seen a lot of maga followers shopping on a daily basis. It's not wokeness that is killing the company, it's mismanagement, lack of understanding at the corporate level on what goes on at the store level, extreme understaffing and higher price points in which a lot of other stores can undercut them. To have such a dramatic drop even during the holiday season is a worrying sign to say the least, however it is not because of the orange cult leader. || I can guarantee you people are not avoiding Target because it’s too “woke”. My MAGA relatives are not above going to Target lol || >which kills, jobs

Idk where people got this idea. Buying stuff online still requires jobs, they're just different jobs. || Its not covid that did this. || So if I walk into Palmetto State Armory, I'm paying top dollar for *any* gun I purchase. Any gun. 

If I go online and order the same gun and wait a few weeks, I'm getting a deeply discounted gun and usually a rebate to send off to the manufacturer. 

It's now turned into whether or not you want it right now, or you can wait for it to be shipped from any retailer. Patience in buying saves you a lot of money. || That is alright, everything is gonna change under Trump. Because he will bring back jobs to the USA. I m sure customer service will be greater than ever before. I mean who doesn't like working in factories for 12 hours and taking home $1100/month? || You don't need $20 an hour to survive

Americans just have an expensive lifestyle lmao 


Halting new home development, not funding affordable housing complexes and all these ridiculous taxes on home building supplies make life even harder. || Not to mention at stores like Target from the moment you walk in until ythe moment you walk out you are being video recorded, scrutinized, LLMs analyze various biomarkers or behavioral markers for anomalies, these stores essentially have FBI teams investigating your every move to make sure you don’t steal. 

FUCK TARGET || Target, Michael's, and Jo-Ann Fabrics all feel like they're *juuuuuust* this side of collapsing. Jo-Ann's is definitely the closest though. It's a little worse and a little less staffed every time I go in. || Yup, I used to assume buying in person would be cheaper than Amazon because they arent shipping right to me. But nope, the local target by me is usually 10-20% more expensive for most household things compared to Amazon. || The thing that kills me with Target is items in the store occasionally cost more (sometimes significantly more) than if you ordered the same goddamned items for drive-up from the same exact store. Drive-up requires employees to collect and process your order, store it and bring it out to your car. Why is THAT consumer paying less than one who does their own shopping, uses self-checkout and bags it themselves?

Employees will adjust the price to the one in the app upon request, but why should you have to scan each item with your phone to check the price to make sure you aren’t getting screwed? || It's been many years since I compared, but when I initially started setting up subscriptions to items I would traditionally buy at target (detergent, toothpaste, deodorant, paper towels, etc) everything was already cheaper on Amazon. And with the amount of subscriptions I have, I am always getting the extra 15% off too.

I am genuinely surprised Target hasn't launched a subscription service like Walmart yet. If prime raises their price again, I am going to seriously look at switching to Walmart because I don't really buy other things on Amazon like I used to. || > leadership isn't quite sure what they are doing

in a report heard this morning (cnbc?), it was reported that TGT overstocked in prep for the port strike that didn't happen and the storage costs exceeded savings. || When are people going to realize that TGT is mismanaged, has a product mix that is inconsistent with today's consumer, has no new ideas for turnaround and seems to be hell bent to follow the Kmart plan to irrelevance.
Investors outta be picketing HQ and demanding real top down changes.
I'm sorry for the employees who are overworked and short-staffed. || The theft one specifically in Harlem, is hilarious because they said they had to close the old one down in East Harlem because because they had so much theft.


But them they just opened a new one on 125 street which has pretty much the same customers.  || What you are saying is that Target haw cut employee expenses about as far as they fan in order to transfer as much profit to corporate as possible.  
   
Meanwhile they post now hiring signs at various stores knowing full well they do not intend to actually hire anyone. 

All of which impacts both the shopper and employee experience.   
  
Maybe a 20% drop isn’t enough.   They sound like they are running on a knifes edge. || The need for never ending growth by cutting necessary expenses. I’m seeing this at my company too.  || I’ve been shopping at HEB.  Fully staffed. All registers manned. Incredibly pleasant experience and they are making money hand over fist.    Same with costco.   
   
Sounds like the idea of slashing employees isn’t the right one. || I can't with Walmart. Even when they are staffed (which i cannot remember seeing) they have the worst employees of any store or restaurant. Nobody ever smiles, or even really acknowledges your question. Miserable place to shop. || Not true in our super center 1 2 registers open( one for cigs) and rest is self checkout.  || Last time I went to WalMart I texted my wife ""long line"" and then checked the time when I finally checked out.  It took 27 minutes. || That's prob because of retail theft is high in your area || Idk about you dude but I like to leave my house and go outside. || Do you have any links for these types of interviews with Costco execs where they talk shop and such? All I can find are interview questions for careers at Costco lol. || Walmart did beat. My opinion is that Walmart is seen as low cost/value chain. 

Target is not seen like that and frankly in store prices reflect that on non essential goods. Noted in the article, they cut prices on essentials and saw growth in those areas. 

Also noted in Walmarts earnings is that more high earners are shopping there. To me this indicates the “self fulfilling” portion of a recession. Consumers anticipate worse economic conditions and therefor cut spending to preemptively ready themselves.

I.e. Higher income shoppers are trading in Target items for Walmart items in anticipation of an economic downturn. || Target shoppers go to Walmart when they are worried about the economy and their paychecks. || You'll see literally no impact in 2025 
Maybe by 2026, but that'll just mix together with broader economic trends with have existed for decades. || Did you do this in January 2021 as well? || The same administration that promised a border wall, mass deportations, and a plethora of other failed promises? This time is different right? || I’m agree with this assessment.  Target is the middle child who doesn’t know who he wants to be.  

He’s not super cheap like Walmart, not exclusive membership like Costco, not cheap online like Amazon. || You go to Cisco HQ to buy routers and switches? Lol just joking... || Target went from being nicer than Walmart overall to being Walmart with slightly nicer homegoods. || I wish Cisco gave me chicken, all I get is the same crappy blue console cable I already have 100 of || Just burn your money at that point. Cause anything from Shein collapses in a couple of months || lol no || 23andMe

I'm holding bags, please and thank you 🥹 || We need an index tracking u/Jackfruitcrazy51 's wife habits. || I can tell you what she doesn't buy, Lululemon || To some people, comparing a company with a 12 PE ratio to a 55, matters. Also, if you're looking at Amazon as a retail play, you need to do a little more research. || My wife is always there must be good😂 || You never want to run out of TP when you have the morning runs. || Lmaoooo || Yeah buying groceries from target just feels icky to me. Super limited and meh produce and the rest just is expensive compared to supermarkets || The point is all this pearl clutching over organized retail theft from 2022-2023 was them lying through their teeth to their investors. Costco wasn't very subtle back in 2022 in calling them out for that smokescreen. This subreddit of course believed it and blamed Biden.  Now everyone who was dumb enough to ""be greedy when others are fearful"" and bought shares is looking and feeling stupid. But I'm sure that dividend is providing copium. || I was *totally* saying theft is cool and fine.  

Reading must be hard for some. || I mean duh but I didn’t think the price differences were that much of a difference || Na. When feeding my family I go out of my way to find places that offer vibes and atmosphere. Fuck my wallet || You'd be surprised || sums up why Trump won in a landslide lol || Yes Walmart is the biggest grocer in the country. Kind of hard to believe as someone who shops mainly at Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods, but it makes sense. || 6% down ytd and flat 5 years.

Had a big run at some point indeed. || It didn’t? || That’s why I bought some just now :) || You're way off

Costco is middle class

If anything, Target is now working class too. Their clothing isn't expensive. It's right there with Wal-Mart and what Costco offers. You don't find $100+ shirts or jeans at Target.

Nordstrom Rack would be middle class while Nordstroms is upper class. || > Walmart is working class

Walmart in-store is working class. W+ is a free benefit on Amex cards, and I suspect (based on the few people I've talked to who have done it) this may create a sub-set of Walmart customers who treat it like Amazon - delivery only, and never enter the store. Could be something to watch. || Yeah, the Walmarts I've been to lately (probably 3 or 4 in the last year, when traveling around the US) have gone all-in on self check, which is great - people complain about doing their own checking, but before you'd be in a ten-minute line for the one 95 year old checker lady, so it's clearly better (for me, at least) || Don't know what it's like in America but here in ireland it feels like there's 2 class of people now, those who own their home and those who don't.

Those homeowners, especially those who bought even just a couple years ago are doing fine. They're seeing wage increases and as their house purchase price is locked in, it's fine.

While renters are seeing house prices soar, rents soar and are living month to month. || Aldi is goated || To quote Marge Simpson ""We can't afford to shop at any store with a philosophy"" || Rent and housing costs are just too damn high. I work 55+  hours a week and can barely afford my tiny studio apartment. I only make like $17 an hour but still. || I used to talk shit about Walmart and now we are Walmart+ subscribers because of the delivery aspect. || I feel like it was undervalued to begin with. Target is literally one of the only stores left that is an activity rather than just a store. The teens go there to hang out. They are opening two new targets near me right now. They have clothing that is affordable and stylish. Their customer services Is amazing. They might have to be less lax on their returns though. || Your broker works for you, tell him to take his “moral horse” until afterwork or you get someone who is working for his clients || Lol as much as Id like to yolo options, I want to have kids one day and cant risk my savings for something like that. I try not to buy anything I wouldnt plan to hold for at least a year. || Fr, do you want to shop with hot moms or obese welfare recipients on electric scooters with 96 cans of Pepsi in the cart. I’ll pay a few dollars more for the former. || This is facts || Bro...it's not 2004 anymore no one goes to Target.  Why would you do this? || As much as reddit wants to disregard the right as a group of fringe crazies, they're about half the country... I definitely think thats part of it. I know a lot of people who dont shop there anymore because of that stupid shit || Really? Look at the woke companies. Starbucks, Nike, Disney, etc... Now tell me how they're doing. Exactly. || It’s definitely less jobs. Online is more efficient. So way less workers and a lot of stores close down || Yeah, so instead of working facing the public you can work in a giant windowless maze the size of 5 targets. Just the further atomification and self isolation of our society. Pretty soon there will never be a reason to leave your house. || I always love this shit. In a store, it requires a person, at least someone to just look to see if someone’s not stealing at self checkout and for stocking, but what happens when this is shifted to warehouse? 

Well, fuck hiring people, when I can just have an automation system built now that will pick any part or product for the cost of electricity. Fuck hiring staff for my small business when I can run the commerce, marketing, and finances from my  single laptop. || Gig jobs with no security, protections or benefits. || Depends on where you live, how good of health you're in, family circumstances etc. || At $20/hour, the cheapest 1 bdrm apartment in my county is going to take up almost 75% of your paycheck. Before taxes.

Is sleeping indoors a luxury lifestyle now? || “Target sucks because it’s hard to rob” is quite the take. || Commercial rents are way overpriced. And maybe warehouses are underpriced. || Savings are even greater if you have staple items on subscription basis. || Walmart online beats Amazon on the regular, I definitely do more business with them due to price. || They have one for $99/yr with 2-day shipping or same day delivery.  Just no streaming perks like Amazon/Walmart. || It seems like they are trying to operate brick & mortar stores as normal stores AND warehouses, but refuse to allocate the payroll necessary to be successful in doing so. I feel terribly for the demoralized employees who are being stretched impossibly thin. || Oh, they absolutely will constantly hire new people, they just won't give them many hours (some working 4 hours a week even though they're promised 20+) and they cut hours from the employees already on staff. || Yup. HEB is so pleasant, and the staff bags your groceries correctly. Love HEB, good customer service always wins.

I go into Kroger and it's not as pleasant and food quality is not as good. I go into Target and see one cashier and self check out, the light is dim and stores look a bit disoriented. I miss Target of yesteryears...the CEO needs to go. What has he done to my Tar-jay! || Nobody shops at Walmart because it's jovial 😆 shit's cheap || Why should minimum wage workers smile at you lol. Such a weird entitlement to have.  || In a super center? No way! What state? || I had an exchange on diapers we got from a baby shower. I gave up after 20 mins. Went across the street to Target and got store credit in like 5 mins. I avoid Walmart at all costs. At least the couple in my area are horrendous || Must be store-specific.  I go a couple times of week and never wait for more than one person usually. || Its corporate policy is to charge +14% on outside items and +15% on Kirkland Brand items. There's a podcast called Acquired that does a deep dive into the business and its history. They have very few SKUs so every corporate buyer can gain additional knowledge of the products they purchase and the cost rational from the company. 

Costco wanted to sell mixed nuts, and mixed nuts sell well, but their buyers didn't understand the margins based on costs from the established brands, so costco only sells their own blend. For staples, the market analysis is probably even easier with more available data. || Those with a 150, 200, 25k income, and moderately savvyy investing, they value TIME and $$. So going to Walmart, given upwards inflation, is a way to protect time and $. Walmart got this and gets me as a client. Could I go to a nicer, better looking store? Of course, but then I feel self duping as an investor. || Depends on how fast and aggressive the admin is with the tariffs. Suppliers and stores aren't going to wait to raise prices if they see the cost increases set in stone. || Good thing a lot of stuff I bought will last years. I might honestly never have to buy trash bags again. || [deleted] || It's cute you think companies won't raise prices immediately either to gradient into necessarily higher prices later or just cause they'll take any reason to raise prices when they have something external to blame. || Nope, I didn't forecast that supply chain issues and super low interest rates would cause inflation, but in insight I should have. Live and learn. || Who knows, all we have is their word to go on right now but indications are that they're going to approach this time differently. Also very funny that the best case scenario is that the administration is either lying or incompetent. || Lol, the downvotes whenever you say anything negative about that goon... I guess too many Trump supporters in Reddit. Funny how they roam Reddit and still think his policies benefits the economy... || I mean, she probably bought 23andMe once and then never again, right?

Seems like you had the right data but the wrong conclusion || I also choose this guy's wife's spending habits || Target is 12? || The main issue is just bad commercial real estate speculation. Stores expanded based on highly optimistic assumptions, and they either bought land or locked themselves into long leases with bad terms.

Target Corporation has a target demographic profile of price/sq ft. and price/acre when compared to median/mean income within the area and housing prices within the area. If you run the low performing stores through those metrics, they're the ones that wouldn't get approved as a viable real estate play today. || They're not. I'll pay a few cents more and go to a store that's clean. || > sums up why Trump won in a landslide lol  

I don't think you know what a landslide is. || Ride it down the rest of the way, I like it. || What’s the difference between Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack? || Exactly what we're seeing here, the emergence of the asset owning class and the working class. The asset owning class owns their home(s) and plenty of stocks. The fed printed a ton of money and went all in on QE, and this inflated asset prices.

If your housing costs are fixed and your net worth doubled in recent years, you're sitting pretty. If you don't own assets, then the last few years have been brutal, with inflation figures likely feeling understated. Additionally, food and housing inflation have been particularly bad, and those disproportionally take up a larger portion of the budget of a typical working class family. || Ya I saw this in Silicon valley and other HCOL places. Ppl with low interest locked in low home prices are doing amazing with rising incomes. Ppl with market rate shelter costs are suffering because rising incomes aren't matching the obscene housing costs. 

  
End up with a K shaped society causing frustration. || America is large so cannot talk on all of it. But in my area of high housing/rent, you are definitely doing better if you bough anytime 3 or more years ago. Before interest rates jumped. My mortgage is significantly lower now than local rents. Like 20% or more less. It was pretty even when I bough 4.5 years ago. || Lidl too! || Aldi for the dry goods, local Mexican joint for meat and produce. Even accounting for the time suck, it's still cheaper than Jewel/Marianos/Sprawlmart || Plus is a game changer. Haven't stepped in a Walmart even for groceries in last 3 months. And the best thing is I get my groceries delivered in an hour or less just for 3$ without having to pay for express delivery just because the demand is not there yet  || Yeah, I get W+ as a bonus on an Amex card and it's great. I will cut my hand off before I have to actually go into a Walmart (if I need more than a self-checkable basket of items) but with delivery it's fine. || Yeah, my guy will tell me I'm being a dumbass, but he would do it anyway - it's not his job to prevent me from being a dumbass || I wouldn’t care because I would never see either of those people again. Rather have the money || Ah yes thinking with the peepee has never steered anyone wrong... || They are 22% of the country according to elections statistics. Half the country is just what they want everyone else to think lol. || They're all... not broke? And isn't big tech super woke? The largest companies in the market? || That’s just cherry picking || I have had this dystopian thought that in the future their won't be many retail stores everything will just be warehouses that you order online and pick up or delivered. || Have you ever worked retail? I guarantee you 90% of the people would rather put items in boxes than dealing with the demands of insane customers || As an introvert this sounds good to me. || Ill take that over having to talk to a bunch of Karens all day. || So many people eat like our healthcare is free || You can build a warehouse in the middle of fuckin nowhere as long as your trucks and employees can get there. Target needs to be in a high traffic location with a big parking lot. Real estate for the latter is significantly more expensive. || You guys are in luck. Because Trump is gonna bring manufacturing factories back to the US. No more 4 hours. Everyone can work to their heart's content. 12 hours shift, 7 days a week! || Common courtesy? If I come up and smile and ask you a question the normal reaction is to have a similar reaction. I’m not asking them to be stepford wives. Just don’t be rude assholes.  You’re stocking shelves. I’ve been there. It is not difficult at all you will be fine  || WI. May be they just analyze if they have lots of losses from theft at the self check outs and our area is not very affected by it. || Exactly.  And the greedy pricks can double dip - raise prices based on incoming tariffs and then raise prices again when the tariffs are actually implemented.  Hell, they can raise prices again after that too when they start seeing prices on imports going up.

It's gonna be a shit show. || Most of it is journalism trying to get views over inflation fears. But the fed will keep cutting rates? Campaign promises are just promises, very very few administrations actually deliver. 

Almost no journalism critiqued the years of free money, astronomical QE, student debt moratorium, rent/mortage moratorium, PPP loan 
forgiveness, and clearly visible inflation drivers from both administrations. 

But a campaign promise suddenly is a game changer? || They do offer more than just the blood test now, but yea, not the same 😅 || Correct. Lower is better. || Leases are a huge problem. Commercial real estate is an enormous bubble and the few leasees they have are losing their shirts trying to pay rent. || That’s what I think too but I guess the earnings say otherwise. || Hell yeah, buy high sell low || Only if you assume all non voters disagree with them. Id guess they're about equally ideologically split. Especially on social issues which people tend to be more in tuned to. || Kinda of already half way there. But I think there will always be a need for retail space. Maybe just a bit less. It’s definitely nice to see stuff in person and try things on sometimes || Having worked both retail jobs and jobs in mail order warehouses I would choose the latter every time. Fuck dealing with Karens every day. || After working retail, I'll never work another customer facing job. I doubt I'm alone in that sentiment.... || I’m an introvert, and I still think this attitude is extremely unhealthy. || Cant argue with that. || i imagine you get very pissy in Europe eh? || >astronomical QE,

That's the Federal Reserve which did that, not Trump or Biden. 

>student debt moratorium, rent/mortage moratorium

Student debt moratoria and forgiveness have always been controversial ideas, and the idea that the media didn't criticize them is absurd. I have no clue what mortgage moratorium you're talking about (or rent moratorium for that matter). || Seems like a really good buy considering q4 is usually a whopper. || I mean yeah, it’s an assumption that is safer to make than “half of non-voters are so political they will boycott stores but won’t go vote”. || But the remaining 28% to get to that 50% number are already too apathetic even to vote, do you truly think they are motivated enough to follow some flimsy boycott? 

My parents are unfortunately deep in the MAGA cult and still shop at target. Their attention spans are fickle, they've already forgotten about that culture war. Fox News has manufactured like 20 pointless culture wars since then. 

(also, the original poster who made this claim has apparently never heard the common phrase ""correlation does not imply causation"". They are just making an assumption based on no data and claiming it as fact.) || Exactly, even introverts need human contact and to not have an inherent distrust of others. || Eh most people I met were courteous. One purposefully rude person in Paris. But otherwise it was fine. Can’t find a single Walmart worker that doesn’t seem like they wanna off themselves unfortunately  || I guess Google is down:

“Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act created a foreclosure moratorium for federally backed mortgages on March 18, 2020. The moratorium ended on July 31, 2021.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_eviction_moratoriums_in_the_United_States


Yes, the fed is independent of any party. Doesn’t mean they get a pass for inflationary pressures. 

Media outlets and even the fed were all saying “inflation is transitory” and just due to supply chain issues. 

And student loans were paused for 4 years.

Theres more hysteria over a campaign promise than any of the actual factors that lead to inflation. || I disagree but also dont care enough about the topic to keep arguing lol. Would rather discuss if this is a buying opportunity or not. || People think “introvert” means no human contact, when the reality is it’s more quality over quantity. I don’t have a ton of friends, but the ones I do have are my brothers and sisters for life.

The problem is now there’s so much you can do without human contact at all that people have replaced it in their lives. And then we wonder why our society is falling apart. || An eviction moratorium is not a rent moratorium. If you didn't pay your rent in that time, the landlord could evict you once the moratorium ended. 

States with cold weather prohibit utilities from disconnecting people during the winter so they don't freeze to death. That doesn't mean that people aren't obligated to pay their electric bill. 

>Media outlets and even the fed were all saying “inflation is transitory” and just due to supply chain issues. 

And they were correct. Inflation is now below 3%, it was caused by supply chain disruptions, and it was killed without raising unemployment to 10%, which people like Larry Summers thought was necessary. Or do you think the eviction moratorium caused inflation to spike all across the world? || Fair enough."
Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

What is your opinion? Have there been any misdirection from ASML or is this frivolous?

It is exceedingly rare that the CEO would overwrite those with own, materially false claims. In particular, in a Netherlands company of such high visibility.

"Trading algorithms, how do they operate?","At 9:30 basically everything starts moving the same directions, including crypto. I’m just wondering how this happens, is it that all the major players use the same basic algorithm or that there are many different algorithms that see what the others are doing and react to each other in a chain reaction?

What’s the general logic they use to make decisions? Are there people directing them at all or is it just totally automated?

Snowflake Q3 Earnings,"- Product revenue of $900.3 million in the third quarter, representing 29% year-over-year growth

- Net revenue retention rate of 127%

- 542 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million

- 754 Forbes Global 2000 customers

- Remaining performance obligations of $5.7 billion, representing 55% year-over-year growth

Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025, ended October 31, 2024.

Revenue for the quarter was $942.1 million, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Product revenue for the quarter was $900.3 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Net revenue retention rate was 127% as of October 31, 2024. The company now has 542 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million and 754 Forbes Global 2000 customers, representing 25% and 8% year-over-year growth, respectively. Remaining performance obligations were $5.7 billion, representing 55% year-over-year growth. See the section titled ""Key Business Metrics"" for definitions of product revenue, net revenue retention rate, customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, Forbes Global 2000 customers, and remaining performance obligations.

""Snowflake delivered a strong third quarter, with product revenue of $900 million, up 29% year-over-year, and remaining performance obligations of $5.7 billion, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 55%,"" said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake. ""Our obsessive drive to produce product cohesion and ease of use has built Snowflake into the easiest and most cost effective enterprise data platform. That is what’s leading us to win new logo after new logo, expand within our customer base, and displace our competition over and over again.""

The big question is how long they can keep up this momentum, especially with competition ramping up in the AI data space.

The cost of renting storage and servers from cloud providers is much lower than the revenue generated by the product built on that infrastructure.

SaaS companies use public cloud infrastructure so that they only pay for what they use, only use what they need, and can scale up instantly with customer growth.

I Still Can’t Understand WHY? And Why Keep Going? I just Don’t Get It!!,"u/[G-Money1965](https://www.reddit.com/user/G-Money1965/) on r/wolfspeed_stonk:

How would you explain it to a Judge?

When this first started, and the stock price was at $142, I sort of understood it. The Institutional Buyers came in and bought 98.4% of every single share that the Company had issued. By Dec, 2021, between the Institutions and the Management Team, they already owned 110,549,191 shares of the 112,346,000 shares Issued and Outstanding by the Company at that time.

I have never shorted a stock and the bullshit excuse that they always give regarding the “need” for shorting shares (to add liquidity into the Market) is complete and total bullshit. But at least I understood why Wolfspeed stock was being shorted back in 2021 - 2022.

In 2020 – 2021, the Institutions were wetting themselves to own the single largest SiC manufacturer in the World that was just getting ready to undertake an expansion to blow the SiC Market wide open and further expand their lead in the SiC Market, and to even take a bite out of the Silicon Market. But the Stock did get out in front of itself.

And all of that did make sense up until 31 December, 2023….

But on 31 December, 2023, something changed dramatically. Shorting Wolfspeed went from being an “investment” into something sinister, nefarious, and ILLEGAL!!!!

On 31 December, 2023, Short Interest was only 15,651,500 shares. Look at the Short Interest during the second half of 2023. It dropped from 20+ million shares down to 15.6 million shares. Up to this point, everything looked normal. “Investors” shorted the stock and when they figured they made all their money, they covered their positions and moved on. Pretty normal stuff. That is how the Market works.

But something changed on 1 Jan, 2024. Starting on 1 Jan, the people who started shorting Wolfspeed were no longer “Investors”. During Q1 2024, someone decided to short 4.6 million shares. The stock price fell from $45 down to $25, but these people are no longer “Investors”. If you are an “Investor”, when you make your money, you leave your position. And by 31 March, Short Interest had gone from 15 million shares back up to 20 million shares.  

And less than three weeks later (19 April) is when I caught Shaolin Capital Management getting into the action. From 1 Jan – 31 Mar, short Interest went up by 4.6 million shares and on 19 April is when Shaolin made the single dumbest trade that I have ever seen in the Stock Market in 35 years. Someone shorted 4.6 million shares (in Q1) and the stock price dropped from $45 down to about $25 so Shaolin figured if they shorted their 3.75 million shares, the stock price would probably drop down to $10 or so. But they got the rude awakening when the Institutional Shareholders bought all 3.75 million shares and the stock price went up by $6/share.

And this is where I start to get REALLY confused….

If you are a “normal” Investor, you take your losses and move on. Shaolin tried to cover their 3.75 million shares between 5 May – 12 June and I have already hashed this timeline until I’m blue in the face, but it would appear that whoever is shorting Wolfspeed is no longer just acting as a normal Investor(s). Since the first of the year, Short Interest has gone up by 20 million shares. I understand that they KNOW that they cannot ever cover their position(s), but since 14 June, they have made their illegal activities blatantly obvious. I don’t know if this is sheer desperation or what, but they just keep making their situation worse and my estimates today are that they will lose at least $10 - $15 billion in a short squeeze (at least 2 – 3 times what the GameStop Hedge Funds lost in 2021.)

And the single biggest question for me is that if these guys end up in court, what will they use as their defense, as to why they are trying to short Wolfspeed stock down to $0.00?

Trying to explain to a Judge why you think the single largest producer of Silicon Carbide in the World who just went through a $7 billion expansion to increase their production by 30-fold, and you have to convince a Judge that you believe that Wolfspeed is going out of business?!?!?!? Because there is NO other explanation other than the fact that you might be colluding with someone else to try to steal the Company in some form of a takeover after you have driven the stock price down to $8/share.

It is just incredibly difficult for me to get my head around this and I’m trying to imagine how you explain your logic to a Judge?

If anyone here has some logic, feel free to share it. How would you try to explain to a Judge your logic for making the stock of a Company like Wolfspeed go to zero? Or do you just try the old “gee, we made a mistake and got scared so we just kept shorting the stock” defense? I just don’t get it!!!

The stock decline makes complete sense

The company’s financials look awful. Q3 rev was 195mil but the cogs was 231 mil. Not even including OPEX, how is that investable? || Tldr? || Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. Wolfspeed held a dominant position in SiC substrates and epi until Chinese companies started to sell material of comparable quality at half the price. Their margins went to toilet. That coincides with Wolfspeed’s multi-billion dollar investment in capacity expansion and transition from 150 to 200mm wafer size. Their timing couldn’t have been worse. In addition, they made another multi-billion dollar investment in a brand-new dedicated 200mm chip fab in Utica, NY. The chip production started last year, but the fab is still operating well below 50% capacity. If that wasn’t bad enough, 2024 is a year of global pullback in EV demand, which has beed the main driver of SiC growth. That caused an oversupply and resulted in price erosion. So, every SiC device Wolfspeed ships is probably wrapped in a $1 bill. They’re trying to stop the bleeding by shutting dow their old chip fab in Research Triangle, NC and laying off 20% of workforce. The CEO was just fired without naming the successor. 
So buckle up, it’s going to be a bumpy ride. The good news is that SiC value prop is fundamentally sound: it enables high efficiency electric power conversion for transportation, data center, industrial, consumer and utility grid (e.g., renewables) applications. Which means Wolfspeed may get acquired by a bigger power or analog semiconductor company. That buyer will have to be a US-based company, because the technology is of strategic importance to DoD. || Dude, have you not looked at how shit their balance sheet and income statements are looking?

Huge and increasing operating losses, the price to book ratio isn't even that heavily discounted.

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",ReindeerApart5536,2024-11-22 06:17:53,0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,None,"Nothing you mentioned suggests that the company is making any money or will make any money.

Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. I would like to add tolerability, Viking is also far superior.

Are you saying the drugs I listed in my analysis will not create a market? Or are the drugs too ineffective? || the critique is not necessarily about the effectiveness of the drugs but rather about the broader market and financial issues 

the company is not yet profitable, and clinical success does not guarantee commercial success. Many promising drugs fail to translate into meaningful revenue due to regulatory delays, manufacturing, etc. GMP and GDP is hard, and EU regs especially are rough. 

the market for weight-loss drugs is becoming crowded, with established powerhouses like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. wegovy is a meme. Viking will need significant resources to carve out market share.

lastly, the issue of insurance coverage is critical. If insurers are scaling back coverage for weight-loss drugs, even effective treatments may struggle to gain traction, as out-of-pocket costs might soar. major factor limiting the broader adoption of similar therapies!
could the stock moon tho? of course, this shit is all random anyway. || Hi thanks for the more detailed responses, but my position is still largely unchanged and several responses:

1: Your first concern only manifests if I choose to hold until commercialization, but I can name in numerous pharma firms who made very promisable profits before even full on commercialization. ie before the full commercialization of its COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna's market valuation surged due to strong Phase 3 trial results, government contracts, and partnerships. Also, BioNTech rose to prominence during its COVID-19 vaccine development with Pfizer, achieving substantial valuation gains after early-stage clinical success. This will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts I provided.

2: The market for Viking is dominating looking as of now. I've responded to someelse to, but here let me restate the comparative advantage of Viking. First is tolerability, for Mounjaro, common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, typical of GLP-1 agonists. But with VK2735, participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms. I'd also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of Mounjaro due to side effects, now compare the frequency to Viking. For Mounjaro, participants achieved an average weight loss of 15-22.5% of body weight over 72 weeks, depending on the dose (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg). This means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame. Compare this to Viking which is NOTABLY only in its Phase 2 mid-stage trial, participants experienced a 15% weight loss over just 13 weeks. Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. These all prove that Viking has a clear comparative edge as of now, unless you can disprove these facts.

3: I think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term. But in the long run, I believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition; it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions. Effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications, so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment. 

If you still maintain your position, I really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day, I'm just an average investor looking for more insights."
What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

I know I am misunderstanding something I just don’t know what. Any clarification would be appreciated. ",TheSimpleNomad,2024-11-21 19:13:44,0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgkyw/what_am_i_misunderstanding_about_spyi/,None,"Dividend stocks in general don't grow as quick as others because they pay out capital they could be using to expand their business.  A great dividend stock will usually go up very slowly.  

So if you invest 100,000 in a dividend stock you might get the 7% high yield divi but if you invested the same in a tech stock it might have grown 25% in the same year.  So really you lost potential earning.

ISPY is very different and risky.  It gets the very high yield from daily covered calls.  So your losses could be much more if the market goes down.  They don't have a long track history to see what it would do in a bear market.  I would be very careful investing long term in ISPY || Two things to consider with dividend stocks:

1. You pay taxes on those dividends, while buy and hold you can defer until later. 
2. The dividend usually comes at the expense of the share price, so you make get $10k in dividends, but your net asset value will decrease to $90k. 

It’s the second one that dividend bros forget. || >If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time

sort of but also not really. over the long-term, several decades, a 7-8% average after adjusting for inflation is probably reasonable. but that's not a guarantee. The S&P 500 averaged about 5.5%/year from 2000 to 2020, and closer to 1%/year from 2000-2012. 

>Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

here's what you're missing: 

- SPYI's 12% yield is only partly dividends. dividends are essentially a form of profit sharing, and the S&P 500 current dividend yield is about 1.3%. if you bought something like SPYD, the highest-dividend stocks in the S&P 500, the yield is about 4%.

- much of the 12% yield from SPYI is due to ""covered calls"", which is a complicated form of options where other investors pay you money for the option to buy the stocks you hold now. 

- this can generate a lot of income, and it works well if stocks are steady or going up. but if the stocks go down, you can be forced to sell at a loss to the people who hold the option contract. look up what happened to QYLD a few years ago, similar strategy and it hasn't recovered from the Covid crash. || That makes sense thank you || Isn’t the dividend also higher during draw downs? At least that’s what I’ve noticed for the premium ETFs || I watched SPYI for about 12 months before jumping in.  It's true that the growth isn't the same as SPY but there hasn't been any net value decrease so far aside from the first few months.  I got in at 49.60 in May and its at 52.19.  And while SPY has gone from 529 to 590 in the same frame - I didn't have enough capital to make it beneficial.

I've seen 3200 in dividends and 2600 in growth on 50k in those 6 months for roughly 5800.  In that same amount of time in SPY would have yielded 8400.

This just happens to be my strategy for my 401k, where I balance growth ETFs with dividend ETFs. || That’s for the response, follow up questions

1. If it is in my Roth, that wouldn’t matter right?

2. I don’t understand that, wouldn’t it increase my net assets by 12%?  $100,000 (Original Investment) + $11,950 (TTM) = $111,950? || I appreciate the detailed response 🤝 || How can a covered call force you to sell of the price goes down? That’s not how it works.  || We have spyi, qqqi,and qyld.  We have these in the traditional Ira and our hsa. We purchased ata good price so all up about 6% or so .  This is just one of our plays with owning selective mags stocks and voo . I really like them in our hsa fund .  It literally pays for our medical without having to draw down the principal. Oh our boo is up 40% from last year or so || No the divi does not go up when the price goes down in covered call ETFs. || You also watched it during a huge spy bull run, so all you’ve seen is the CCs capping gains but no NAV loss.  As you pointed out, it still underperformed buy and hold spy. 

On a down year it’s going to be catastrophic. || When a dividend is paid, the stock price decreases by the amount paid out. The money doesn’t just come out of thin air. || Why is the divi in JEPI higher in down months then? Wouldn’t the increased volatility lead to higher premiums on options and thus higher dividend payments? || CC funds outperform the underlying in a down year for the underlying || It isn't 1:1. The asset may just not increase in value.  Where company Z may have x amount of growth or cash on hand and the value of the company goes up, the company with a dividend pays it out to shareholders and the price goes sideways.  I would say the dip usually comes from people selling after Dividend date || I'm not trying to start an argument but this is a bit of a truism. The price/value connection is remarkably elastic and a fair amount of the time companies are really good at destroying the value of retained earnings they could have paid out as a dividend. || The dividend is up in down months because JEPI is doing ROC, and is essentially charging you a fee to give your money back to you. 

These CC income funds look good but they are a huge dividend trap and should be avoided. || Only if the premium outpaces the NAV erosion. || From an accounting principles perspective it is 1:1. Market conditions can change the stock price but at a pure principles level the cash paid out comes directly from the companies assets. || Or large institutions, they keep track of SHYT like that || There is no NAV erosion if the market is declining and your calls never end up being exercised || Sure, but is every dividend stocks price based exclusively on how much cash on hand it has? No. || If the premium generated from the calls is less than the yield of the fund, then they have to sell the underlying at a loss to make the yield…. And the NAV itself erodes in a down market simply because the underlying asset is down. 

You shouldn’t talk about things you don’t understand. || You should consider your own advice. CC funds don’t have a fixed yield, so if premium is light then so is yield. They don’t eat into assets to pump yield || Depends on the fund. Many attempt to always hit the same yield (like QYLD), and will use ROC to achieve this if they have to.  You need to read the prospectus. 

I’m sorry, you aren’t going to win this one kid. || Oh man, if you’re that condescending you must be right. My bad!"
Nvidia Options Action 11/21: Confusion,"So I have 3 Nvidia calls: 160 11/29, 150 11/29, and 150 1/17/25. P/L on the three is about even and got the 160 a few days ago on a dip trying to make a few bucks betting on earnings driving the price up. As we all saw they crushed earnings and the stock moved up a few points.

What im confused about is the value of my contracts dropped pretty significantly at open although the stock was up. Ive been trading options here and there for the past couple years and seen some “odd” action before but nothing like that. Seems completely opposite what youd expect, can some explain why that happened? Not particularly pressed, a little disappointed cuz i wanted to sell the 160 at open but just confused.",Independent-Skin-550,2024-11-21 20:15:36,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwhx38/nvidia_options_action_1121_confusion/,None,"IV crush. || You just learned what IV crush is || https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1gwhtu4/nvidia_calls_went_down/ly9az3t/ || 1. Iv relative to what it was at close yesterday, right?
2. I assume once the dust settles, if and when, people stop selling so many contracts, the value of my contracts would go up. Is that a valid assumption? || Yes. For Nvidia, the rise and fall in implied volatility around earnings is much higher than typical stocks. 

No. The value of the premiums was increased around earnings. Based on your post, I assume you bought your contracts close to ER. || Ok thanks for the info. 

IV was high bc people were waiting on earnings, earnings came out, and IV dropped causing the value to drop. I knew volatility played a part in the value equation, didn’t realize a swing could negate an upward movement. 

Ya learn something new everyday lol || You said you traded options for years... You didn't know about IV crushing profits? || I traded options in S&P 500, UPRO, and other ETFs, rarely individually stocks and I didn’t trade that frequently. I could be wrong, as im just learning about IV crush lol, but I would imagine the IV of ETFs doesn’t fluctuate as much as stocks like Nvidia.

I mentioned times I found price movement “odd” and looking back it was probably, at least in part due to that. 

Also, this clears up something i’ve been confused about for a while. I understand that some people take profits around earnings, but I wondered why stocks that the market seemed to like, crushed estimates, and provided good guidance, dropped after earnings. Knowing that IV crush is a thing makes it make more sense now, although ofc its not the only/main factor for the drop in price. || That is true. IV of etfs would still fluctuate around important events (for example, before and after US election). But a lot less than individual stocks that are bound to company schedules & announcements.

Its really the expectation that a big move will happen, that is baked into the contract price."
The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

How? Chrome being sold doesn't mean it stops existing. Why would anyone switch browsers because the company that owns it now has a different name? || Username checks out || Opera has made a perfectly fine browser that many people like for many years. Even before Chrome was the staple browser. Whether other browsers are owned by google or not isn't going to make Opera more popular.

Now, if they reach a bundling deal with Dell or something, sure. This though, I don't see it.

If somehow Opera DID manage to increase their userbase substantially and in a relatively sudden way, I'd be all over it. The fact that they're a profitable company is pretty interesting.

Also you have to keep in mind that close to half of Opera's revenue is ad/search payments from google for driving traffic to their search. What's bad for google isn't necessarily bad for Opera, but if google cuts their payments for advertising or search referrals, that would be really bad. And I wouldn't put it above google to try to run a browser competitor out of business if they win this DOJ case.

OK, I understand that Opera doesn't ""advertise"" gambling.  Still, I say ""Gaming"" + ""Gambling"" = Profit

I'll see how it plays out over the next 6 to 12 months. || This entirely depends on how the DOJ goes about breaking them up. If they force Chrome to sell, I don't think there's a company in the market who would be allowed to buy them and/or have the funds to acquire it.

If that's the case, other browsers would be given an opportunity to gain the market share that Chrome would be losing.

  
EDIT: I'm imagining this the same way telecom was broken up back in the early 2000's. The companys split into smaller companies that were eventually gobbled back up over time. || The alternative to ""no buyer exists"" isn't to destroy the product, it's to spin it off as its own company, no?

That sounds like the reasonable thing to do, at least.

Edit due to your edit: In the case of a spin-off the core question remains: Why would anyone switch to Opera just because the owning company of Chrome now has a different name? || No. || In theory yes that would be the right choice. Like I said though, it entirely depends on how the DOJ goes about breaking them up. || It doesn't, though, does it? You're basically saying there is a realistic chance for the DOJ to force Google to basically delete Chrome off the face of the earth as that's the only way consumers would move to other browsers (unless another browser company buys Chrome, but if that company isn't Opera it still doesn't matter, and if it is Opera it will have cost them money to buy Chrome, but that aside you even said this isn't an outcome you expect, so back to square one).

I just can't see a universe where that would be the outcome. || This assumes that Google even gets broken up. Trump will be President soon, DOJ will likely get shaken up, any decision won't be made until summer of 2025 and will probably be appealed. || You still didn't answer the question."

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence.

>There is a serious legal bar between ""difficult to find"" and ""nonpublic."" ""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let's illustrate this with a few examples.

>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company's upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that's really an edge case and isn't relevant here.

>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company's stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn't restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)

>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you've been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can't trade your own company's stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.

>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.

>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they're complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn't help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it's well-founded (I'm not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don't understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don't know is illegal to use.

There is a lot of things he can't do, and I presume that's how platforms try to ""combat"" insider trading. But the main issue with that is that my friend can easily open an account in another brokerage/platform and do whatever he wants. Even if we assume that platforms will evolve in a way that they will prevent this too, there is no way to stop human interaction: my friend can just share the insider information with me and I would do the trades.

Part of what I do revolves around policing this stuff.  It's not easy, but trade and comms surveillance is one place where AI is making huge strides in finding uncommon patterns, both in trade activity and in the language used in communication channels (email, whatsapp, SMS, etc.).

It's not a huge step from clearly suspicious activity across a few mediums to a personal phone records subpoena, and bam.  Busted.

There's no way to truly know how much insider info is being exchanged and acted upon illegally, but certainly the new tools are finding maybe 3x more than we were just a few years ago.  I'd say we're now catching maybe 15%-20% of this kind of non-compliant activity.

EDIT:  If you work for a broker-dealer, I will tell you *everything* you do any any corporate issued device is captured and analysed.  All your email, Bloomberg messages, Symphony chats, Teams, SMS, MMS, desk phone, turret, etc., etc., it's all captured, stamped with you as the ""custodian"" of that info, and run through sophisticated monitoring tools.

"Comcast will announce the spinoff of cable networks Wednesday, CNBC source says","Comcast is moving forward with the spinoff of its cable network channels, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on Tuesday.

The separation is expected to take about a year, and an announcement from the company could come as early as Wednesday, the person said. The company had announced during its quarterly earnings in October it was considering a split of the cable networks.

Selfishly , I'd like Syfy to go back to being SciFi with actual scifi content, maybe bring back reruns of the Invisible Man, Knight Rider, Smallville, Roswell, etc. And have original movies made like the Dune series back in the day. 

With NBCSN long gone and USA going, it'll only leave Peacock and NBC to show the Premier League. They'll probably lean more heavily on Peacock. 

As it is, USA seems to be the least valuable station as it really offers nothing.

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

x86 is just a massive advantage just because of legacy, there are tons of code and binaries in use that are just critical and hard to port to another architecture. And translation layers are... Problematic.

So, on the pro side specially, AMD and Intel are on the winning team, and on the gaming side it seems similar.

Only the basic, web centric use case is where ARM can compete, something more akin to chromebooks and macbooks. But there, as architectures are easier to replace, RISC-V could boom too.

As I see it, ARM is under a bigger threat from RISC-V than x86 under ARM. || I dont think AMD has that level of market power to stop Qualcomm. They will definitely hit 4B in chip sales by then.

The only company with the unit volume and pricing power to pay Qualcomm separately for the cellular capability and a different CPU/GPU is Apple. || Doubt.  || > Intel recently released Arrow Lake

I think you mean Lunar Lake. || Neither Lunar Lake nor Arrow Lake is selling all that well. Intel even admitted that Lunar Lake is more of a niche product with terrible margins compared to Snapdragon X Elite that has been a broadly launched product in the market.


Snapdragon X Elite is fine and developers can use it to further optimise their code for successors that will be released on a regular basis. || Yea well both new processors by Intel and AMD perform better across the board while consuming less power and having no restrictions on what apps you can or cant use, so theres ARM for ya. || He's probably talking about the rumor that QCOM may buy INTC. || No insight needed… their genuinely shit. || Legacy compatibility of code is just a massive factor.

ARM is under a bigger threat by RISC-V where code compatibility is not an issue, if we're talking about architecture comparisons.

x86 is more than safe, and a winning bet especially in professional workloads and gaming. || Wheres the link chief? || Intel has fallen behind and they will soon be eliminated. || Writing off Qualcomm after their first gen implementation seems foolish.

>QCOM set out new targets at an investors day on Tuesday. Perhaps the most eye-catching was targeting revenue of $4 billion from its personal-computer business by 2029, laying down a challenge to AMD and INTC. [](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/intc?mod=article_chiclet)

>That represents a little over 10% of the estimated size of the total chip market in Windows-based notebooks and desktop computers, Qualcomm’s Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala told *Barron’s* in an interview on Wednesday.

>“If you look at what happened in Macs, Apple took their phone chip, supersized it, and put in a PC, and the performance was outstanding…we are doing the same for the Windows ecosystem,” Palkhiwala said.

>...

>It’s an ambitious plan, but will likely need to be to make up for the expected loss of revenue from Apple. Qualcomm currently builds the modem chips that the iPhone maker uses in its smartphones. Qualcomm previously signed a contract to supply Apple with 5G chips for its iPhone launches until 2026 but is still expected to eventually lose a large part of the business to Apple’s in-house chips.

>“We continue to have confidence in CEO Amon’s ability to move Qualcomm beyond a modem and cellular IP company to become a true broad-based semis player… That said, if there was one knock, we think the loss of Apple will weigh until 2027,” wrote Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland in a research note. || Muddy waters is short supposedly, dont see the report itself though || I was rooting for Hogan as Education Secretary but it was not meant to be. || Just love watching all the appointments of people who have never run a large complex organization or even have managerial experience. || In other words smash and grab?

I worked with import data for years and it you do not search correctly (tariff code,  entity name (spelling mistakes), location, product description) you will be mis-led.   In addition, the import could be handled by the freight forwarder; so you really need to look at entire harmonized code and back calculated.

ELF could also have a toll manufacturer purchase materials and have them packaged here.

I have no position, but watching how this plays out. || I haven't read them, I don't own it for reasons unrelated to the business, so I'm a little behind. 

Your description is almost exactly what I would have expected though. || The primary crux of the report is that they see imports go down big but revenue stay the same. ELF says this is because they changed the way they accept orders, saying they accept orders when it ships in China as opposed to when it arrives in the US. Muddy Waters says because imports are down this means they are just straight up lying about revenue, profits, and forecasts. How is this possible?

It’s parabolic up.  They have delay upon delay of Blackwell.  Breathless reporters are starting to sniff around and see if anyone is actually making money on their massive AI expenditures.  Their top 8 (?) customers are all actively trying to develop their own chips so they don’t have to keep ordering from NVDA.  There will someday be a shift in bias from learning to inference.  Nvidia’s near total market share means there’s more room downward on M.S. than upward.  Same thing with margins.  Nvidia valuation is reliant on some whale customers, any or all of whom could get whacked by political chaos at any moment.

Again, I’m not selling into this, but the points against it aren’t really crazy are they?

There’s others that are more far fetched, like people thinking a competitor will surprise with an equivalent performing chip at a fraction of the price, or that a quantum computing development will render NVDA’s AI obsolete overnight. || No financial advice but rklb lunr and asts will go up or down || Just don't.

From a fundamental view I agree with the Morningstar report that stated it is now priced for the lower end of management estimations through 2030. As they had a very big gap between lower and higher end of estimations, I think there is a lot of upside potential with a limited downside risk. || I'm fairly new to it (a couple of weeks), but noticed it drop somewhat pre-market when this article was released. The further drop after open appears to be related more to the morning market dump. It read to me as a positive thing. The stock has been on a tear, and paying off debt completely seems like a positive...just wanted to hear thoughts from others. I've been a diehard index fund investor my whole career, and only recently dabbling into individual companies. || Both. I've been long on POWL for a while and it ebbs and flows like that. I actually thought it was going to sale off after the earnings, since the pattern for a bit has been more of a pop on earnings and then the stock more or less trades flat or down until the next earning report. 

Same with FN, news seems to be related to some fears around a report from B.Riley: 

>Analyst Comments: ""We downgrade Fabrinet to Sell as the unbundling trend of $NVDA's GPU platforms is expected to negatively impact FN's optics business. We lower the price target to $178 from $194, applying a cash-adjusted P/E multiple of 16x (previously 17x) to our FY26 EPS estimate.  
  
""Historically, $AMZN, $MSFT, and $META have purchased NVIDIA's GPU platforms, such as the HGX H100, which include integrated optics supplied by FN (via Mellanox), Coherent $COHR, and InnoLight. However, Alphabet $GOOGL has been an exception, purchasing only GPUs and assembling its own platforms.  
  
""Our checks suggest AMZN is shifting its purchasing model to buy NVIDIA's GPUs separately and build its own platforms. While this change does not affect NVDA's GPU business, it impacts its optics business as AMZN is a significant customer. We believe $MSFT and $META are likely to follow, given their existing capabilities to produce GPUs and other technologies, which could further challenge FN's optics business."" || Looks like the swing trades have paid off. I'm up like 14% off POWL and 7% of FN. || Good points, I think risk reward looks good at these levels. 
I’m reasonably comfortable with next year’s inflationary outlook, sure labour will creep up due to labour’s recent interventions (not implemented until April 25) and cpi is running at a modest 2.3% today and I think the impact of both will be marginal in construction if inputs remain consistent. Let’s not forget construction is littered with self employed people who are well paid.

Vistry shares the burden of inflation with the supply chain, this probably means that certain rates are locked in for the year. e.g they’re unlikely to be exposed to any significant labour inflation. It will be similar for plant, materials will probably hold the greatest exposure but these are probably locked in instances of low to medium inflation.

Also they’ll reduce exposure as inflation will be incrementally applied throughout the year. 

I figure there’s upside to this ntav backed market cao even if for some reason the partnerships migration flounders, they can just toggle back to traditional house building. 

I hold and I’m at maximum position size. || Bad luck... it may go down to around 550-600 imo, but it's becoming pretty cheap on a forward basis. Downside is probably limited from here, but who knows.

The btc move from $50k to $95k has only moved MARA from $15 to around $20.  There’s an argument to be made about a halfening along the way, but even if that were accepted at full value, it’s still no longer correlated. || Because you hate money?

This assumes yesterday's price was correct and today's is not. 

You are paying 20% less than you would have yesterday, which might have been 20% too high. Or 10% too high. It takes time to figure that out. I remember when people here were buying TGT at $180 claiming they just got a 20% discount because it was at $240 before.... || They put prominent displays of gender fluid swimsuits in the children's section. Some suits brazenly bragged they were ""tuckable.""

When parents got angry, TGT complained it removed some displays to prevent violence, so in essence, they painted their own clientele as violent assholes. || Right so the dozens of videos I saw on Twitter with people filming the displays in the chidren's section was just my imagination.  And parents definitely did not stop shopping at TGT... It's just a coincidence their stock price has collapsed since these incidents occurred.

So go ahead and buy shares.  I mean if you really believe what you're preaching. || you can live on real estate, you can eat sugar, you can burn oil, you can build with steel. But bitcoin if nobody else wants it, well... || Its definitely a scheme. More like trying to corner a commodity than a ponzi to me || It's not really all that different than any stock. You are just buying leveraged BTC at this stage. || Bitcoin isnt a ponzi but MSTR is definitely a pyramid scheme || BTC isnt a ponzi. Its just an overvalued speculative asset.

Let’s not forget construction is littered with self employed people who are well paid.

I don't fully understand the inputs in terms of materials and how inflation is working there. At this moment I don't even know the ratio of labor vs materials costs that is maybe something one should look at.

Vistry managed to force a 10% discountt on all its subcontractors a while ago and they sold it as a win so I guess they have some leverage as they are able to provide a continuous stream of work to them.

> Vistry shares the burden of inflation with the supply chain, this probably means that certain rates are locked in for the year. e.g they’re unlikely to be exposed to any significant labour inflation. It will be similar for plant, materials will probably hold the greatest exposure but these are probably locked in instances of low to medium inflation.
> 
> Also they’ll reduce exposure as inflation will be incrementally applied throughout the year.

Looking forward, a higher inflation environment will be priced in indeed that is also not a concern of mine. I'm more worried about projects that were launched assuming an optimistic scenario (remember they get paid in advance under partnerships so they have to hit the mark or face losses). I remember reading something about them also going quite low on some of their bids for projects.

> I figure there’s upside to this ntav backed market cao even if for some reason the partnerships migration flounders, they can just toggle back to traditional house building.

Vistry is currently trading below book value at less than 8 times ev/ebit. That means it's basically treated as a run-of-the-mill homebuilder. Once the company manages to demonstrate that their partnership works and their ROCE goes to the moon (to levels of Countryside) it will rerate for sure. The bull thesis is quite clear here it's now all about managing the downside, figuring out how the whole thing could still fall apart.

Did you buy on this dip or are you an older shareholder? || They been doing that for a while. In fact, ARM and QCOM have had some lawsuit issues recently. 

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2024/11/07/qualcomm-and-arm-trade-jabs-ahead-of-december-court-case/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2024/11/07/qualcomm-and-arm-trade-jabs-ahead-of-december-court-case/)

QCOM has been wanted to get into the PC/Server chip business for a bit. It's actually what the lawsuit is about. 

>""But then in 2021, Qualcomm bought a chip-design company called Nuvia, which had its own license agreement with Arm. A key issue at stake in the upcoming court case is whether Qualcomm thus automatically acquired the rights to use Nuvia CPU designs that incorporate Arm IP. Qualcomm believes so and has acted on that basis. Conversely, Arm’s position is that the Arm architecture license with Nuvia was not transferable without Arm’s permission—something it could use to trigger a renegotiation of the license on financial terms more favorable to Arm."" || It's basically the network effect in an asset. If enough people believe then it's real and valuable. If there is increasing demand for something on a limited supply then the price will go up. Also as the dollar continues to inflate and devalue the BTC-USD price will continue to go up. I personally have stayed away from crypto but that's how I understand it. GenZ seems to be very into it so it could have a lasting effect. We haven't seen a significant crypto winter in quite some time. It will be interesting to see what happens if/when that occurs. || >gold was valuable because it's shiny and rare and used for jewelry

Bitcoin is also rare and useful. || It’s essentially due to it being unhackable and decentralised. These two things are simple but very powerful. Pretty much entirely secure, no hacker or super advanced AI will be able to breach it. It has the potential to outlive nations and centralized currencies. And its price is based on supply and demand in the most transparent way possible, with clear set limits and largely grass roots initial distribution. Yes people will try to manipulate the price and profit from it like anything, but the core economics of it have a beautiful simplicity and purity to it. I think this is important more in the longer term sense of a trust and transparency in the working of the system.

What the other guy said about it being valuable because people believe it to be valuable is something that people say who have decided to form a closed opinion on it before looking into it at all. It’s true in a sense but the same is true about anything we assign value to, and is not the actual specific reason Bitcoin has value but just a general statement about humans and value. || Bitcoin is essential and irreplaceable by any atom known in the universe for peak electronic conductivity in critical computer circuits and interconnects.  Oh wait sorry no, I’m thinking of Gold not bitcoin || [removed] || Cool information, but that doesn't change that the SOXX chart looks absolutely awful, and in the most likely case, the chart is gonna win. 


Taiwan Semi in particular since you named it is probably good 10+ year buy, but over the next 12 months, it retracing to $150ish wouldn't be a shocker. || Yah a bubble that popped at 175 || Gotcha what strike and date are you targeting if you find mind sharing? || Imma go with what the ceo said bruh || Yes just about, but not a very compelling or worrying one. How about the data points before this? || I suppose things will even out at some point and competition will increase a lot, especially when big technical hurdles get reached that difficult to improve past, just didn’t think we were that close yet, but really need to look into this stuff more, even though not invested in NVDA. 

Maybe AMD can take market share from them soon, I guess that alone could hurt them a decent bit at this point. Are there any other real players though? || Best money you'll ever spend.  Or be foolish and lose it precisely like I did. || I hadn't heard Chris Mayer sold it. Where did you hear that? || The numbers were great, but bolstered by a few one time items that made them look better. Is say they were good earnings. 

I agree with the sin stock and European ideas too. Also, I think there are fears over the European tax increases, which I believe hits their balance sheet next year. 

Either way, I think it's a solid long term hold. || Idk if you meant to responding me but I don’t understand your comment. I am not permabull, I don’t even own NVDA.  I just found their comment to be funny and surreal, nothing to do with NVDA itself. || You can’t look at stock price, u need to look at mkt cap because these shtty miners dilute so much.  Mara at $24 now is like $60 back in 2021. || Yeah you’re just paying a 200% premium to holdings, way better || I couldn't care less about crypto || Always another play out there || Why would you want to do this? Take a step back and think it through. Best case, the investment does well, and now you’re dealing with taxes, logistics, and awkward conversations about what they owe you (if anything). Worst case, it loses value, and you’re the one they blame, potentially tarnishing your relationship. Either way, you’re taking on all the risk and stress with little to no upside for yourself. If they want help opening their own brokerage account, sure, help them—but investing on their behalf is a headache, at best, waiting to happen. What’s in it for you? || True I suppose, my NVDA proxies have been AVGO, CLS, ANET, and PSTG which has worked out decently but would have been easier to just own nvda lol || Right. I'm a retail trader and I do the best I can with very limited information. A 20% discount on a large and established business is a lot more enticing than a 20% discount on a lightly traded stock or a memecoin. || I remember that.

1. There were no “tuckable” items marketed at children or in the children’s section. That was a lie promoted by the far right. 

2. Customers were actually engaging in threatening behavior. || And... crickets.   How predictable || If nobody wants it it goes to zero, but that is not what a ponzi scheme is. || So the fiat currency sitting in my digital bank account is also part of a ponzi scheme. || please explain how it is leveraged || Thanks for confirming that were still early in this cycle when normies like you keep fudding. || Yeah it was an odd reaction to the report. I don't believe trends always work, but owning the company for a while, normally it pops off earnings and then trades flat or down until the next quarter. 

This time it ran heavy into earnings and I figured it would trade down. 

I opened a new account recently with 500 of fun money to see how much I can make from it. Same with FN. I'm long on them and price drop seemed like a way overreaction to the news. || Yeah I knew they were kind of bogged down with an ARM lawsuit for awhile so I figured they haven't gotten into laptops yet. I'd expect the royalty/license issue to get resolved pretty quickly, potentially with an out of court settlement. Too much for both of them to lose if it goes fully to one or the other side given their codependent relationship. || Thanks. I read the article on investopedia.. It seems like a big advantage of bitcoin is that it is resistant to the money-printing process (and other inflationary factors) that governments cause. || > We haven't seen a significant crypto winter in quite some time. 

Going from 69K to 15K was enough winter. || There's a lot of names in the semiconductor industry that are not anywhere near as good a growth option as tsmc, and heavily weigh down soxx when compared to the individual company. Tbf I tend to pick stocks over ETFs. If there's a dip to 150 I'm definitely buying more, I got in last year so I'm up about 60%, so a dip would still be beating s&p which is my goal. I don't see tech becoming less prevalent. || !remindme 1 year || December 13th expiration, $91 strike. || Prob a smart move, wasn’t trying to advise anyone to sell their stock or make any financial decisions. Was just advising of a trend I noticed in the gross margins pointing out that’s why the stock may be down in after hours. 

But as usual, pointing out anything even remotely bearish during a euphoric market gets downvotes lol. All good, I think regardless of what the CEO says it’s still good and prudent to review all the data and take everything into consideration before drawing your own conclusions on where you want to invest your money! || The data points before this they were increasing, margins were expanding, and that’s when I was buying. I still own shares in Nvidia and I won’t be selling, but I’m definitely not buying more shares now the margins have clearly peaked in this cycle and are now declining. || Let's just say these are still rumours at this point. If you want to believe these rumours he also sold $ODFL. For sure what is public is that Chris said he is building a new position in a VMS company (see his twitter). || What about an ETF/Stock that I’m not involved with? Would that be less complicated? Like I have VOO in brokerage and VT in roth. Can I just dump it in VT In brokerage and leave that for them? || I see. It’s for my parents. It’s their lump sum and they just wanted me to put it in for them but yeah I see what you mean || I think one of my biggest flaws as an investor is to try to be contrarian. If I see something going up big I try to find a diamond in the rough. Some sort of alternative that people are overlooking. But usually you're better off just following the masses on these trades. AKA I bought AMD instead of NVDA at the start of the AI run. || Right, but decline =/= discount (necessarily). There's a really large amount of information out there for retail. For free. I'm also retail. || that ponzi scheme is backed by the military and the power of legal violence. || Think of it like using $5 to get exposure to $15 worth of Bitcoin because MSTR borrowed the extra $10. At least that's how the MSTR buyers are thinking of it. They are also thinking that MSTR can keep borrowing money and pumping BTC. 

It's still insanely risky, but so is all leveraged trading. || Yeah that definitely makes sense. I like your fun money account idea, seems like a good way to test your instincts without risking too much. 

I had a small position in POWL from last year, I assume hearing about it from you. It’s more than tripled since then, and I feel awkward about holding even though it’s still in a good position.  || Yeah, I think QCOM is like one the biggest customers and the CEO of QCOM was one of the people who talked about just having the industry names come together to just buy ARM, since it seems a lot of moving towards that architecture. 

I think a lot of the price movement today is from the investor day and Apple news. || Meh, I think it's fine to quote them as a group, because they have all had terrible price action.

|-|-|-|-| || Lol ill set one too in case it's still trash

!remindme 1 year || That’s fair. I don’t see it as something to be concerned about but at the same time I don’t think it’s a compelling buy right now. There were positives too. Trading flat makes sense to me, it’s very slightly down now. || Not sure why you would want to take a cut of this anyway. It's all theirs. If you want to help, help. If you want to get paid, get a job. If you think they should pay, they should be paying someone who doesn't need to ask Reddit questions because they have the necessary education and experience to make decisions themselves || But the buyers are really using $15 to get $5 of btc… || One thing I've learned over the years is take profit. I like the approach of just taking out your initial investment and letting the rest run, it's just house money at that point. 

Like I made that mistake with $SMCI. Not to be that guy but I was like one of the first people really talking about them here, when it was like 90. I sold out after doubling, but the stock continued to run. 

Don't get me wrong, I try to be transparent. I'm a software engineer and know the basics with investing, so by no means a pro. I've also recommended some bad names as well, but that's another thing I've learned over the years, winner out weight your losers. 

Yeah the fun money idea was just a way to swing trade and have fun in the market. That's one thing that people forget sometimes, like you can treat investing like hobby. It's been a bit of a bull market, but started the account on Oct 25 and I'm up now up to 831 dollars. It's also something where if I lose it all, I'm still fine for my financial situation. || Funnily enough of the group I only have Tsmc and NVDA 😅 I'm just a sucker for the big names probably, which may not be great long term.

"Exciting times for space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks!","Space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks are ripping and roaring. There are lot of small to mid cap companies in these industries that could one day be mega cap companies - picking the correct ones is the hard part. 

Would love to hear everyone’s favorite companies in these three sectors, supported by a little explanation as to why you think they have a bright future. 

I am particularly excited about these three industries because I believe the number of satellites in orbit will grow significantly in the next 10 years. I am optimistic that SMR nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years. And I believe quantum computing is finally here, and real world applications are popping up every day. 

My personal picks for these three categories are RDW, OKLO and IONQ. Let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options. I have a small stake in all three. 

Apreciate the responses!

It offers a really nice exposure to certain areas of the space economy specially in manufacturing. They have some interesting work on compound synthesis in microgravity, solar panel fabrication as well as reactor design for different types of chemical synthesis. || How tf does this have -1 comments?

Edit: well.. now it has 0.. 

Also these stocks are giving me PTSD to 2020 EV stocks || I am all in on RKLB, I am just hoping for some correction so I can buy more lol. Started buying back in July, Currently at 420 shares and plan to buy many more for the next few years.

I am also looking into LUNR and Redwire, but not too sure on them at these levels. I may go into Redwire due to the smaller market cap but will see.

Open to suggestions for quantum and nuclear stocks. || Besides a spread between GSAT, ASTS, LUNR, RKLB, IONQ I have also a position in ASPI which will start to produce HALEU fuel for nuclear reactors. This is currently only developed in Russia so besides the need for more fuel there’s also from the west a security sentiment. || OKLO is crazy volatile but I’m in. Rigetti and IonQ basically going straight past Lamborghini into Bugatti. || The sleeping giant is MDA space from Canada. One of the few space companies that are profitable and it’s going under the radar because it’s on the Canadian stock market || Just made 400% off rocket labs lol, unfortunately it was only like $300 that I initially put it, sold it only because I feel it's overvalued atm due to WSB lol. I'll get in again after it comes down a bit || Loving my cameco rn || Check out BWXT does anyone know about this company ?? || These 3 themes were very high on my list and I've been adding to each for a while.  I haven't diversified as much but primarily stuck with RKLB, UEC, and QBTS.  May look to add other companies if I find a opportunistic dip but I'm quite happy with these 3 as my core picks in the 3 sectors you named. || Space - RKLB. a clear leader in the space market alongside SpaceX. International market is another huge growth area. Compliments SpaceX for smaller loads. Would like to buy SpaceX as they launch IPO

Nuclear - CCJ is emerging as a leader in nuclear race regardless who runs reactors. I also own URA (to catch on the rest of nuclear sphere)

Quantum - I think NVDA is the name benefiting indirectly and directly. || Here are my picks for space and quantum stocks. Quantum stocks got hit pretty hard yesterday. Now’s a good time to hop in if you haven’t yet.

Also adding to this, we are still early on LUNR, RKLB, ASTS, etc. Don’t let the recent gains sway you from jumping in. These stocks have a long way to go and the upside looks HUGE. NASA has taken the stance of allowing private companies to bid on their missions. Their whole initiative right now is to stimulate growth and stir a “lunar economy” for the private and public sector. 

The reality is here. We ARE literally going to the moon. LUNR has a mission planned in February. I expect to see a steady creep up in price and another big jump as they have a successful mission in February. Others should follow along the same path. Space stocks are a great long play. I am holding until retirement. Good luck out there fellas! || BN for the win 🥇 || Quantum :Iona and riggeti 
Space rklb 
Nuclear : Oklo || I have shares and Leaps for RKLB and RDW (rdw more calls out 6 mn as Fidelity didn’t have leaps).



Made a pretty decent return so far. Cashed out my $7 and $10 RKLB leaps for 300% return and am slowing buying $25 and $30 leaps. || for space I have rocket lab and lunar

don't have anything nuclear wise, any suggetions?

for quantum I have IonQ || Why quantum computing? I get the other ones why they are going up, but why quantum computing at this moment? || I been tracking $IONQ since before their IPO so def invested there.  Especially when it dropped into the $3-$5 range. || OKLO...
I'll enter if I see a major Pullback || Is there an ETF with these or many of these stocks? || Cameco is a more established Nuclear company and UUU is a smaller nuclear company with a lot of promise || Of all the stocks mentioned in this thread, GSAT has the best chance to become a conglomerate with Apple's backing by becoming the its telecommunications arm. 

And I'm not just talking iPhones, AR/VR headsets, watches, glasses, cars, other sensors will not need to rely on a terrestrial network to operate or talk to each other. I know people in the telecommunications industry and they see this Apple's intrusion into their territory as the biggest existential threat in their 100+ years of operation. 

LUNR is still relatively cheap compared to the others who have several billion market valuations. The thing about LUNR is not their moon landers, they're aiming to be a space communications company by building a constellation around the moon and will likely expand outward over the next decade or two.

I am sour on ASTS and RKLB chances. ASTS ran up based on assumptions and analysts reports before the Apple/Globalstar deal was announced and before the election results where Musk will muscle Starlink into ubiquity and can afford to undercut them on price until they're out of business. They still need to raise billions to support 90+ satellites or however many they need. Tim Farrar, a respectable communications guru believes they'll eventually go bankrupt as MNOs start to bail on them.

RKLB is an interesting case, it's being seen as a proxy to private SpaceX but the fact of the matter is they make most of their money by selling ""space systems"" and not on launches. Launch providers, in the west are going to be dominated by few players, namely SpaceX, Arian, and possibly Bezos' Blue Origin. They may be fine in the long run but they're overvalued now because making satellites and space systems is a commodity these days. 

OKLO and IONQ are just too early, there are many companies well ahead in terms of small reactors and regulatory approvals than OKLO and on quantum computing, see what IBM and Google are doing on that front. || you can have space and nuclear in one stock :) Rolls Royce Holdings || For quantum, I'm going Rigetti RGTI. They have US based chip fabs, hopefully a future CHIPS act contender.  Dwave QBTS is another quantum company. They just fought off delisting without a reverse split.  

For space, I'm into Rocketlabs RKLB and Intuitive Machines LUNR.  RKLB until Q2'25 orl Neutron launches.  Once LUNR lands on the moon and has its moon satellite network up, it will be unknown territory. || GRRR, RKLB, LUNR, APLD || Ionq just partnered with Nvidia on classical quantum AI… Similarly Nvidia is partnering with Google on the same tech… Next 5-10 years will be very interesting || Save || Top || Saved || Not really individual stocks, but I recently parked a bit of money into the VanEck's Nuclear ETF. || It is a high risk play.

Asts has actual 5g and thousands of patents. || Remind me! One year || Your point on OKLO is simply not correct, they have the quickest timeline amongst any domestic SMR company, targeting 2027. You spamming FUD on them to drive your puts isn’t working well. || I'm not bullish on OKLO because of their reactor technology. You are correct. Several companies are further ahead in the development and regulatory approval processes. I'm bullish on OKLO because they are also fuel rod manufacturers, and are close to nailing recycling spent fuel rods into fuel for its plants. Especially with the news coming out of Russia that they will be limiting uranium exports....recycling spent fuel rods will be there true money maker... || I think of them as a car company,  will definitely check this out. || I own RYCEY and heard rumblings about their SMR. Do you really think they can be a major player? I know the CEO is trying. If they can nail smr, an energy stock valuation would be justified. Imagine a 200 billion dollar evaluation one day lol. I don't think its impossible || Not true. They are actually behind OKLO by at least 5 years… see my comparison post here, last section.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/XVW3TWSGe7 || Sir, you’re in a stocks sub. We like to get excited about stocks. || ASTS will be bankrupt according to Tim Farrar and others. Starlink will crush it. Apple going with GSAT will render it useless on iPhones. Google (and Verizon) are going with Skylo. Good luck trying to sell a service on a small segment of Android phones. 

Dilution is coming too, enjoy. || Because while Wood is rich, I think she did too much of her own supply. Personally, I wouldn't ever invest in anything ARK. || RKLB works more in the “launch” aspect of the space economy. It provides support for satellite design components, launching services, and satellite communications. I would say they are more like a shipping company. RDW works more with the stuff that will be done in space. Chemical synthesis, component manufacturing, bioreactors and such. Both are quite interesting, RKLB seems to be a more popular trade.  || In my investing thesis I always hold long term. That is, I do not plan on selling in the next 30 years. Unless we get a run up valuation at hundreds of times multiples of projected revenue. To be more specific, I won’t do anything except hold for the next 3 years.  || “It’s about gambling” 

I got lucky and picked a “winner” and still ate shit relatively. 

High valuations based on fluff and hopes of world domination. My point is these stocks will probably see a similar fate of poor returns in the midterm. || I'm not sure about the world being around in 10 years, but at least you have optimism. || Maybe at least half of current price, but I am going to keep buying regardless probably. || I sold off half my shares when it hit 100% gains and sitting on the free ones now. Not buying more until it establishes some kind of base. The bottom could fall out in a hurry if some bad news drops. Also they're being propped up by a literal stream of good news drops every day, that can't last forever.

I do think it's a good company for long term hold, but whether or not an opportunity to enter comes along remains to be seen.

MNO's are fickle and they all rushed to sign up with ASTS because they don't want to work with Starlink, whom they also see as an existential threat and did not anticipate Apple will go its way. 

You're showing your ignorance by talking about SMS and voice, Apple has one of the top satellite engineering groups in the world working on this since 2017/2018.

|-|-|-|-| || I think they're blowing smoke into everyone's ass with their timelines, it will not happen. Why would Google go with Kairos, why would Amazon go with X-Energy? || He’s not correct, which company has a quicker timeline to deploy within the United States? || They have nothing to do with the car brand hehe || NuScale revealed in the last earnings call that they already are building their first SMRs, and AFAIK the design is licensed. I never heard about any problems with the plant but I thought plant design and build was another company, Nu Scale just provides the reactor and that is being built right now || This is definitely an opinion lol || I will be holding even if it goes down to $1 or 1 cent per share idc i will keep buying more when I can. Also please do more dilution so they have more money for business expenses, I would absolutely love that. || Not at all, basically to cover up from upcoming volatility and price swings due the hype in the 'trending' stock. A lot of people (mostly swing traders), that thought that they missed the party are getting in now and they will eventually massively sell off producing a price drop. I'm just waiting for that moment to come, let's see. || I have GSAT as well.  Get ready for the ride! || Might be worth selling at least some for the time being until the current pump dies - rocket labs isn't necessarily hugely overvalued, but the CEO isn't much of a talker and contracts take time to complete for space agencies. I wouldn't be surprised to see a steady dip back to 10 or so in the next 12 month's, and then another big pump as exponential growth kicks in. 

Either way you're in the money imo || Good luck with your investments 🙏🏻 || And Elon can maybe get govt funding away from us but that’s really still not too big of a concern considering we only need 25 sats in the air to start making revenue, I’ll be back in 2027 sitting w $250 per share. || None of this is of concern, our sats were literally just confirmed to be working and operational. #2 MNOs didn’t  just aimlessly rush to pick asts because they are anti Elon? That’s not true at all😂  and we are still the only company to do a 5g call from space without a stupid dish like elons😭. Apple partnering with gsat is literally just for sms texting, their tech is unknown no one is close to achieving what asts has achieved so I don’t know what you mean by me being ignorant?. You really don’t know what you are talking about, our only concern is being delayed and going with blue origin. || By that logic, every other competitor is not doing that with their publicly available timelines- just them?

Secondly, you are asking why the tech giants are not signing deals with OKLO, who has Altman as the chairman. Obviously they know that OpenAI with their massive data center needs would be first in line and they would be an afterthought. It’s a game of securing early 1:1 partnerships where you are the biggest game in town with that energy producer. Altman has that locked in with OKLO via the relationship, even being that an LOI/MOU hasn’t materialized yet. || SMR. They are the only SMR design that even has regulatory approval so far. I'm putting my money on SMR based on the opinion they will probably be first to commercial market with their reactor design. || I'd also bet that Westinghouse will have their smr built before OKLO. || Let me clarify- I’m talking about domestic timelines here in the USA. Are you referring to Africa and Europe? Being that the US will be the home of massive AI data centers to support future AI growth, first-mover advantage in the US will be huge. || I love your enthusiasm || I dunno… I think it’s best to invest in a company rather then dip in and out because of what might or might not happen with market forces. It isn’t RKLB’s fault, Peter Beck’s fault, Adam Spice’s fault, that the stock trended on WSB. It doesn’t change the fundamentals of the company. The minute I start allowing my investment decisions be influenced by what’s on the WSB, that’s when I’ll know this malarkey isn’t for me. || Can you tell me a bit more about GSAT? || Assuming we are still here, I'll follow up because I gots me some ASTS as well. || It's ok, let people have their uninformed opinions. Meanwhile, I'm loading up on ASTS. || Why are you saying ""we"" as though you work for asts or own a controlling interest? Just curious, not a dig. || Not correct. NuScale is targeting 2030s because their customers still have to apply for a construction and operating license (24-36 months) which requires fuel and won’t be initiated for a while. OKLO is submitting a combined COLA (design, construction and operating) next year and targeting 2027 for their first reactor to come online and already has fuel awarded by DOE. OKLO is ahead by a good 4-5 years for this reason.

I had a post comparing timelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/X1nh7Q8uvS || Westinghouse is projecting 2030s for their AP300 deployment, so much later. || Yes I am referring to USA and I agree with your point.

https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/standard-power-chooses-nuscales-approved-smr-technology-and-entra1-energy-to-energize-data-centers

The second link is a years old showing how far ahead are they. To diversify the risk of who actually will get ocer the line first I also own OKLO and others but the biggest position in nuclear i have is SMR so I really value this discussion we have here || I prefer the term “discipline,” a key behavior when it comes to investing. But yes, some enthusiasm is present for sure. || You follow the trends of intelligent CEOs and WSB follows the trends of unintelligent gamblers. Both influence the market.

Having your finger on the pulse is the real smart move. WSB is gonna dump rocket labs and move onto some other nonsense, and you can sell during this hike and buy again after the dump. totally up to you || This is the official description of what Globalstar is all about:

Globalstar empowers its customers to connect, transmit, and communicate in smarter ways – easily, quickly, securely, and affordably – offering reliable satellite and terrestrial connectivity services as an international telecom infrastructure provider. The Company’s low Earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite constellation ensures secure data transmission for connecting and protecting assets, transmitting critical operational data, and saving lives for consumers, businesses, and government agencies across the globe. Globalstar’s terrestrial spectrum, Band 53, and its 5G variant, n53, offer carriers, cable companies, and system integrators a versatile, fully licensed channel for private networks with a growing ecosystem to improve customer wireless connectivity, while Globalstar’s XCOM RAN product offers significant capacity gains in dense wireless deployments. In addition to SPOT GPS messengers, Globalstar offers next-generation internet of things (“IoT”) hardware and software products for efficiently tracking and monitoring assets, processing smart data at the edge, and managing analytics with cloud-based telematics solutions to drive safety, productivity, and profitability.

As I have read in some other articles, Globalstar is part of Apples emergency response feature for SOS and rescue operations.  Apple probably will never let them fail, so they have support, but they are also creating a satellite network to deploy for communities in the developing world, to bring internet and communication services for the public, government and defense sectors. || We as us holders who’ are holding till full constellation , how is this a question lol || NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, you are only pointing to their design certification. In order for their customer to obtain those, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why your second link is projecting deployment in 2029 (read the subheader) which is two years behind OKLO’ 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic. We’ll have a better idea once their customers actually start the NRC review for those.

The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale where **every customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses. || > life savings

> discipline

Are you sure about that || Thanks! || Interesting insight, thanks

What seems off for me here is Why woudnt NuScale go for COLA then? From their website I understand that ENTRA1 is the company that constructs and operates the reactor, NuScale is only manufacturing and their product is licensed. 

I might have to rebalance based on what you said though. Do you have any sources that can help me to understand nuclear laws in USA more? || Discipline because it’s in a proper stock that will make me money. If I put it in a stock that was akin to gambling, such as MicroStrategy or video game store, then that would not be discipline. || You bet, good discussion for sure!

It’s a strategic choice by NuScale and Nano Nuclear to sell designs only and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much** faster scaling.

Recently, the NRC released a white paper stating that once Oklo has the reference (first) application approved, it would only take as little as 7 months to get approval on subsequent applications, or new site builds which further accelerates the timelines.

I’d recommend the subreddit r/OKLOSTOCK, I’m a moderator over there and we discuss many SMR-related topics, not only Oklo. || Thank you! I’ll definitely head over there to see what people are thinking

I just saw on wikipedia that OKLO had the COLA application rejected  in 2022, is there much that changed since then and isnt that worrying for you? || NRC said that the rejection in 2022 was without prejudice and based on a lack of “case studies” provided. Since May’s SPAC, they are in a much better cash and staffing position and have been preparing for resubmission during Q1-Q2 of next year. I’m confident that they will gain acceptance and deploy in 2027, not to mention that OKLO’s board member, Chris Wright was just selected by Trump to be the Secretary of Energy. They stand to greatly benefit from further regulatory streamlining and “cutting of red tape”. There’s always executional risk here, but I’m confident in their leadership team."
"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",Illustrious_Beach,2024-11-20 01:34:07,75,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv6hj0/palantir_short_thesis_and_an_analysis_of_its/,None,"Palantir has been funny to watch. When it was under $10 Reddit hated it and didn’t wanna touch it. I made some decent (small) money trading some calls. Wish I had held longer. After selling my calls I bought 100 shares at $20. I recently sold a CC for $60. Because after seeing it run 10x in under 2 years I’m strongly expecting a pullback. But the shifting sentiment I’ve seen here has been very interesting to watch || It’s objectively overvalued, but people have always been willing to pay a large premium for 1 of 1 companies. Amazon has always traded at a premium. Tesla has always traded at a premium. Costco has always traded at a premium. Ferrari has always traded at a premium. Crowdstrike has always traded at a premium. 

Hope it falls in the short term and you make money. But in the long 10+ year outlook, this is a $300+ stock that’s worth accumulating at any price. || Nothing that deals with tech is priced properly. All kinds of companies with negative P/E and EPS that are astronomical. People swore Tesla would plummet and it did the inverse at a fast clip. People want to believe, so the money goes where beliefs are strong. PLTR will probably hit $80 by Christmas, if I had to guess, unless some dire news hits. No matter how bulletproof your thesis is, you can’t dissuade market sentiment. || Something about the stock market staying irrational longer that something solvent || Yep, I'm going to share a trick with you though, here's a good way to make money, don't short stuff 

Never take trades where the odds are against you. Stocks rise more than they fall, look for good longs

If you do decide you want to trade against the odds and this one I guess is a fairly reasonable candidate just because of the chart. If you use options you're on the clock so that's one more thing working against you, also another rule you should never break, never buy options always sell them. So let's just assume you're going to short shares. If you short $63, your stop would be at 67 on a daily close, not an intra day penetration. There's not really a clear target to the downside though. Maybe $52? But look how much easier this was for the people on the upside. All you have to do is throw a rock at the chart and hold on. For you to make money you have to have your timing right and you have to have a very clear profit target with absolutely no guarantee of that being hit. In fact the way the moving averages and the chart are pointing you're most likely to be stopped out. Still you're only risking $4 to potentially make 10 provided the stock doesn't gap up on you like it has many times before. I don't think there's any near term catalysts but you also don't know when the next bank is going to give it an upgrade and pop it up 5% for the day || Op. I had a similar sentiment with NVDA.

Now here is something else to contemplate: half of PLTR shares are with institutions, pension funds etc. IOW held long term.

On November 26 they will be trading on the NASDAQ and likely joining the NASDAQ 100, which will create even more interest in the shares.

Recent corrections were minor. 

I won't be surprised if it hits 75 soon.

Personally, I'm in it long term,  since I see a huge and stable business here here where customers are locked in long term.
Now add gov contacts...

One more thing: I agree with another poster that it was interesting to watch people slam the stock below 10 Vs the strong momentum we see now. || Would you pay 50 times 2028 earnings for a company with high revenue growth and faang like margins in a massive secular trend that’s compared to the internet? If you believe ai is real, then analyst estimates are too low and that warps your view. Just a thought, not advice || Same post that was on WSB yesterday. 

With how much work you did to write that out you could have spent some time projecting PLTR's revenue for the next 5 years and giving your estimate for margins. Then discounted that back to 2024 and give a PE range it should trade at.

No one will argue that PLTR is overvalued right now but one of the main reasons it is trading at a high premium is the Rule of 40 score is at 68% in Q3. 

Just a year ago the narrative was ""PLTR is only profitable because of interest income"" now it is ""Interest makes up 33% of income"".

Here is what I care about. Karp continues to say they have more demand then they can handle and the amount of time per employee to get customers setup is becoming much faster so customer count will be going up faster.

I would not tell anyone to buy at the current price but I am not selling any shares even if I think it can dip back down to $45. I also would say not to short PLTR until there is confirmation of bearish candle pattern. If PLTR ended today lower then the open, that would have been a bear pattern. 

PLTR is a solid company that will grow big into the future. || Counterpoint: I opened a small short position today, so expect it moon through the end of the year.  || I appreciate this read and can I say I definitely learned more about the company, however I’d like to ask about one specific metric you harp on a lot. 55x EV / sales doesn’t really seem that bad compared to other glorified tech companies. NVDA is at 35.44 and is considered to still be value at its current valuation. In a vacuum, what makes that 55x EV/Sales number so terrible considering their growth and expectations? || > Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag


At least on this note, wasn't the compensation supposed to stop tapering off around now? Karp discussed this back around the IPO, IIRC, and everyone basically ignored it.


The company has undergone massive dilution, but the bulk of that should be coming to an end now. || The market can stay irrational longer than bears can stay solvent || One thing I’ve learned since meme stocks became a thing is that you might be 100% right, but the stock market doesn’t care about your analysis. || I should stop listening to posts that have smart words like “thesis” and instead listen to the guy who bought calls on SNOW because it’s winter || Meh, I'll keep dca'ing every month. See you in 10 years. || Since when was the stock market rational? It's a hype stock in line with current AI narratives, that's all that matters || Sold my lot at $62 yesterday. Been burned enough times before, not making that mistake again. || 100% agree with all your points. I was a PLTR long until around 50 and now I have some long dated puts because the valuation has been quite insane || Just be careful if you planning on making an earnings play || Good thesis.  It's a good short bet just based on It's pattern of shooting up them falling back down.  It follows a bitcoin type pattern if you watch it over time.  (Meteoric rise followed by a crash back down to just sit at the same price for awhile followed by another meteoric rise higher than the last, rinse repeat) ||   
This is not the complete picture: 

>In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing.

Here is Palantir's SEC 10-K for the Fiscal Year ending Dec. 31, 2020:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312521060650/d65934d10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312521060650/d65934d10k.htm)

Page 69 states:

>As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,542,057,292 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, 249,077,252 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock outstanding. 

Palantir ended December 2020 with over 1.792 Billion shares, almost double your claimed amount.  

* 978 million shares is the weighted average for computing net earnings/loss for FY2020 (the whole year, not just December). 
* Anyone looking at revenue/share for 2020 would have taken into account massive SBC in that 1st year.  From what I remember, it was disclosed upfront in the original proxy statement prior to the direct offering.  

  
If you want to look at full dilution over the past year, refer to the most recent Q3 '24 10-Q: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165524000209/pltr-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165524000209/pltr-20240930.htm)

In millions, YoY:

2024: 2,459,589

2023: 2,325,600 		

This assumes that all warrants, options, etc. are exercised and all possible shares created. 

  
In terms of actual existing shares, YoY:

2024: 2,250,032 		

2023: 2,162,530 	

That's just over 4% dilution.  While significant, this is not unusual for a growth company.  Given that Palantir's revenue growth is roughly 27% YoY, investors may consider this dilution to be worth the risk.  

While I agree that Palantir is probably overvalued today [and have advised caution](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/1gus824/comment/lxyqokp/) to anyone wanting to buy PLTR stock at these levels, also think it is a disservice to not acknowledge that the SBC situation for Palantir in 2020 is much different than the SBC situation today. || You will go mad looking at financials, financials are a snapshot where it is...not where its going.

That seems like a pretty large bull signal to me. Corruption, can you smell it?!?! || Thanks for the write up.

I agree with the analysis, but the market will likely need to enter into a true bear market before this one truly breaks down

We shouldn’t have to wait too long though.  Just a couple more rounds of Saylor taking pension fund investment to buy more bitcoin.   How could that ever go wrong? || PLTR now needs to grow annual revenue at 30% for 6 years with no change in EV to match MSFT’s current P/S ratio. MSFT is a richly valued software company.

You don’t need to write a whole post, just that. || We buy high and sell low here || Same. I've had 5k shares for years now and just sold 500 + started buying puts to hedge. At some point its going to pullback and that pullback could be brutal

I do believe it deserves a very strong valuation, but we are moving into bubble territory now || I've just bought ..so you will be getting your pullback. ..such is my investing ;) || What strike and expiry did u sell? || I agree with the first part of your argument, but not the $300 price target. Im not saying its impossible, anything is possible, but that would give Palantir a $750B market cap. They have less than $4b in revenue per year right now. Even if they grow revenue 50% a year for the next 10 years, every single damn year, that still wouldn’t justify a $750B market cap. Keep in mind, they arent even growing their revenue NOW at 50% while they’re still small, and it becomes harder to do that when you get bigger. In the most recent quarter revenue was up 30% YoY. Very few companies in the history of the stock market have have grown  their revenue at 30% plus a year for a decade - think Meta, Google.  Again, I don’t have a problem with you having your opinion, I dint think Tesla would be at a Trillion market cap and here we are, but what you say is far from a certainty. || exactly.  certain companies hold premiums in the market and can be illogical compared to others from a pure numbers perspective.  i think this will only increase for Palantir now with upcoming Nasdaq inclusion and esp. as people start to realize the results it delivers to companies who use it. || Look I own a bunch of $205 CRWD and took tons of insults from kids who claimed it was going bankrupt and that I didn’t know anything about “the cyber”.  But not sure I would agree it’s 1 of 1.  What is your basis for that claim? || PLTR doesnt have FAANG like margins though. || Pltr has been saying for years that their time to spin up customers is miniscule and they can onboard customers SO FAST.

They said at one point they sucked at sales, as they failed to reach the 30% growth projected and even 20% growth at times.

Now they're saying they have so many customers they can't even handle them all, despite their crazy fast implementation times?

And they add what, like 100 customers a year? The rhetoric doesn't add up for me.

I was long PLTR, I still don't believe it's gonna shit the bed and go belly up as a company, but I can't justify this valuation and I sold off from $19-45. Sad I missed some gains but never go broke de-risking and taking profits (and my other stocks I invested in the meantime are also up 3-4x so overall I don't think I missed any growth) || > No one will argue that PLTR is overvalued right now

surely you must be joking.

There are a TON of people that would dispute that, but also would argue PLTR is UNDERVALUED right now. I mean, they are wrong, and certaintly know nothing about how to value stocks, but yeah || Counterpoint:  I just bought in at $66 ..expect it to keep on going down the side of the mountain. || Counter counter point, I hold a decent number of shares and hence I will end up losing money in the process. It never fails to happen. || > NVDA is at 35.44 and is considered to still be value at its current valuation


There is a huge difference between 55 and 35.44 EV/SALES ratio. If pltr was trading at 35 ratio, it's stock price would be 36 or so.


Besides, nvidia has achieved a 120% revenue growth for the last year and has a projected 80% revenue growth for next year. Pltr has a measly 30%  || Of course. Thiel is first world scvm. But we have zero control over the knuckledraggers that worship billionaires. the best we can do now is make some of that Thiel profit before the civil war starts. || Reminds me of meta and Netflix in 2022 || Bubbles buy yachts ;) || $60 strike for 09/25 || To be clear, if PLTR grew revenue at 50% a year then they’d be at $160B revenue in a decade which would absolutely justify a $750B market cap. Not saying it’s plausible that 50% revenue growth happens, just that it takes far less than 50% growth to justify a $750B market cap. If you assume PLTR trades at a similar P/FCF to other enterprise software vendors like Salesforce, SAP, or MSFT; then they’d need ~$50B revenue to justify $750B market cap. Which requires 33% growth for a decade.

That’s still high, but AI as a whole is expected to see MASSIVE growth as well. Depending which research firm you choose to believe, the AI market will see 20-40% annual growth for the next 5-10 years. Given that PLTR is objectively one of the leading names in the space, I don’t think it’s too wild to assume they can sit in the higher end of those estimates, or perhaps even temporarily surpass them. 

$750B sounds like a big number in today’s stock market, but keep in mind that in 10 years we will almost certainly have companies hovering around $10T valuations, and dozens more above $1T. At $750B they’d be a comparable size to where Salesforce is expected to be. A top 30 tech company in the S&P500. Nowhere near the size of the megacap corporations, but doing very well. || That’s true, but the market is trying to discount what palantir’s margins will be, not what they currently are. If you do your homework, you can make a compelling case that operating margins could be north of 30%. Karp even said on an earning’s call that the scale AI provides will allow for higher revenue with the same workforce || Gotcha, i appreciate that clarification. Would you mind explaining how you got to a stock price of 36 from the different EV/SALES? || Thanks for the well thought out response. You’re right it could get there. I was mostly trying to point out that 50.% YoY growth for a decade is insane, like once in generation type growth, and maybe Palantir is that company, and maybe its not, only time will tell. 33% growth forna decade is also pretty astronomical, but more plausible. Even if it doesn’t hit those kinds of numbers, its probably still not a bad investment over a decade. For example , if we end up at a price of $200 a share, instead of $300, thats around a 12% annual return from the current price. || It is insane, in today's nominal numbers.  Put inflationary pressure on those numbers (which seems to be the choice of good ole USA), 750B is small fry.  I keep saying this, where there is war, there is Palantir. || I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir also get involved with D.O.G.E"
"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry. 

https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/",Slyric_,2024-11-19 22:26:35,92,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv1vyw/sony_is_in_talks_to_buy_kadokawa_media_powerhouse/,None,"Saying that it’s just Elden ring or Fromsoft is vastly underselling it. 

It’s a pretty huge media company. It owns a lot of anime/manga publishing and studios and a lot more.

Sony is slowly cornering anime/manga market. And with how popular it is with the under 30 market and growing it could really pay off in the long run. I still think Sony buying Crunchyroll for a billion is going to be seen as a fantastic deal. || not a fan 


more middle managers and VPs to answer to destroys creativity  || This deal is huge for Sony. They’re trying to monopolize the anime industry with their recent acquisition of Crunchyroll and Funimation. If this deal goes through, acquiring From Software is like the little cherry on top especially with Microsoft recently acquiring Zenimax and ActiBlizz || As a gamer, sad to see it. More Concord-style slop on the market is never a good thing. || well, all we can do is hope not || Doing rough napkin math; I'd say the acquisition price could be in the realm of ¥800B, which is some decent upside from the ¥500B market-cap it closed at. Lot of risk on this trade though, as with any acquisition, and I'm just pulling numbers out of my ass here.

Would kind of hope the deal falls through as I feel Sony would only enshitify Kadokawa's IP. || Woah || It's not From that sony is eyeing.

It's anime. || Fuck sony || Thread made me look up Sony stock price to find out they did a stock split and I didnt even notice. || Sony is barely making money with what they have so how is buying more going to make it better?

Sony thinks it is the competition that is hurting profits and not how they manage what they already have? || ugh I hate soul games don't buy it Sony, you are already in so much debt || Think Sony buying Kadokawa is going to kill the industry. || > vastly underselling it

> It’s a pretty huge media company

Pointing out that Kadokawa are larger than just FromSoftware is good, but people are going too far the opposite way, and are overselling how big Kadokawa is. Ultimately it has a lot of assets, but with a market cap of $3.2bn those assets are collectively not worth all that much. || I think Sony has a strong track record of maintaining core philosophies and principles of studios they acquire, at least from the game division. || God of war, Bloodborne, Horizon...... || I guess the question is, does the Japanese government mind monopolies? || Depends on which part of Sony they'll be under, likely it'll be Sony Pictures or Sony Music.  || I don't know, I played a little bit of Astro Bot and it didn't seem very Concord like to me. Maybe I have to play it more || How will this lead to “concord-style slop”? || Using a big bag of money to acquire an already successful company with an established market is very different to trying to make a successful company from the ground up by acquiring successful people and putting them in a room together with a big bag of money.

They don’t automatically end up at the same place, and what Sony is doing here is a well trodden path to growing an already massive company. || Sony Eletronics don't make Concord Phones. || > could be in the realm of ¥800B, which is some decent upside from the ¥500B market-cap it closed at

That ¥500B is after Kadokawa popped 22% on this rumour, which is unlikely to be the baseline of any negotiation. Even so, ¥800B is a huge 60% premium on that. On yesterdays ¥409B price it's a 95% premium.

I don't think Sony would go for it on those valuations. More realistic it's ¥500B-¥600B || They don't really have a lot of debt.

They have a debt-equity ratio of 0.53, an A- credit rating, and are hitting record profits (and part of the reason they have a higher debt load is because of their financial services division, which requires a higher debt load than most sectors). || When have they ever done that? Its not an opinion i have ever seen in gaming || Fucking up helldizers, concord, killing tlou2 multiplayer."

Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)",werewere223,2024-11-19 23:13:58,35,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv32bn/uber_bright_future_or_dim_outlook/,None,"Somewhere in the middle.  Autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off. When that happens, Uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but that's fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own. Uber can also clean/fix self driving cars, but that (which would require stations scattered all around) is a whole other business vs an asset light app.  Some talk that Uber was interested in EXPE and perhaps it tries to diversify (travel super app.)

So I think somewhere in the middle. I don't think Uber goes away by any means, but I can see Uber looking different/very different 5-10 years from now. Self-driving on a massive scale is still a long ways off, but I do think that it'll probably continue to be a cloud over Uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 5-10+ years from now. On the very short term, stock is getting close to oversold. || Waymo has a partnership agreement using the Uber platform. Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of Waymo's vehicles in selected major cities. || They have partnership with Waymo, Cruise and other small providers and even if self driving has mass adoption Tesla will not be the only player, it's a matter of time they try to operate on their own and find out it's a pain in the ass and would partner with Uber to dispatch, maintain and also support the rides...it's way to complicated to replicate Uber and operations whether Its self driving or human driven. || I own and I believe in the stock. It has many markets for growth, multiple sources of revenue and I believe that autonomous will not disrupt its platform how others are predicting. I think it’s depressed right now and the concerns are oversold, which is when you want to invest in a growth stock.

RemindMe! 10 years || Mass adoption of autonomous driving is still far out, in my opinion. Even when it becomes a thing, one bad incident will cause bad press and concerns for people. There’s also always going to be people that want an actual human driver.

As for Uber, I think they’ll be fine. They’re also investing into autonomous driving but also into other streams of revenue. I don’t own the company, but the outlook isn’t too dim. || UBER is oversold/underbought/a buy whatever you wish to call it.

In the short and medium term it is a financial powerhouse, having turned corner and hitting straightaways on revenues and margins.  They’ve broken away from the pack like Lyft and everyone else.  They have diversification.  They are international.  Taxi is fading away, Uber is the verb for all ride sharing, and increasingly, food delivery.

Transportation from A to B isn’t a fad that ebbs and wanes, and Uber is entrenched.

Their last two ERs gave visibility into this power, yet other more random and transient factors have driven the recent sell off.

The perceived long term threat was from Tesla, but the many-times-delayed emperor’s fashion show that finally happened last month made it clear that Uber has several years of safety from that.

I see many posts here worried about a futuristic world that’s years away.  Two things: One, a lot of money gets made waiting for the future to arrive.  Two, big rich incumbents tend to find ways of owning future developments that come along.

On that same front, Waymo is so clearly many years ahead of Tesla, and Uber is already partnered with Uber.

Should the landscape and competitive environment truly change, there will time and opportunities to bail in and out as new information indicates.


You have to pass through the near future to get to the wildly distant future.  Uber stock got thrashed on the vaguest rumor of an EXPE travel merger, presumably because their exec used to work there.  But it never happened and yet the stock price hasn’t reset.  I think before we have flying cars and whatever else, Uber could do things that are more attainable and boring, but profitable.  Instead of flying cars, they could invade the logistics space.  It’s a good fit, and they have the scale to take share and margin.

I’m a buyer in the 60’s with a 90+ PT.  The stock was $87 recently, with no real change in fundamentals since then. || I think the travel industry in general is in for a boom once oil plummets. || I think they will be fine. But just in case, I sold my position. If it drops further I will consider buying back || I just bought some this morning || We will never know for sure until it plays out but I would agree I think it’s more likely a positive than negative. They already have the logistics set up seems much easier for waymo or other party to use them than to try and do it themselves. || Short term still a solid player. Long term i am unsure as companies like waymo, cruise…etc are coming on strong to target passengers market. Food delivery market, dont forget about drone (which i think also owned by google?) || If there’s only one AV player let’s say Waymo. They can probably use their own app. The most likely case is there’ll be multiple AV players so one app for each won’t make sense. Uber can consolidate both human and AV rides which makes more sense for users. I’d rather have one app than multiple. 

Their fleet operations play makes it even relevant in the AV space. Waymo has been looking for partners for expansion and Uber could be their perfect partner. 

This is my bull thesis for Uber. I own Google and started investing in Uber now. || I bought Uber stock about 4 years ago and the main reason wasn’t the share ride platform, but rather they are working to deliver an autonomous taxi service. If anything this is good news. 

Now granted the grift between Elon and our King has already started and I think that’ll make Uber not the top player but a big player nevertheless. || Seems like no moat to me.

Waymo, Tesla and Cruise can make their own app.

Uber is just a middleman for food and ride sharing.

Unless Uber can get solid long term contracts with every fleet. Or buy and maintain their own fleet. I just don't see it.

Also Lyft seems to be profitable now as well. || It's 34 PE. Wouldn't MSFT be a better bet in tech? 


Won't speculate about self driving or economic recession (discretionary spending), but to me, Uber is no different from what Fiverr, eBay, Etsy is for freelancing or physical goods. Just a middle man between two parties, with bad actors undercutting the commissions. Company in the middle of high friction, high risk transaction earning a percentage.  Skip! || They are losing customer trust fast with weird ways they are charging customers based on their regular usage , need of the hr etc || Uber is valued at its future growth potential.

You have autonomous vehicles replacing humans for taxi service.

What do you think? 

Is it too hard to switch from the Uber app to Waymo? Or like is Uber a must have? So there’s no moat. Cool. 😎 || Good analysis. Having recently taken my first my Waymo I am struggling to see where Uber fits into this. Using the Waymo app was almost identical to the Uber one. In an autonomous future Uber becomes the taxi dispatcher and dispatch your ride to Waymo, Zoox, or maybe a person? I guess...   
  
Autonomous at scale is a long way off but taking one from PHX to the hotel and back it was pretty easy to see a future where dense urban cores (and maybe suburbs too) are dominated by autonomous ridehailing vehicles... And you are right about the asset light, pivoting to being the AI mechanics and maintenance isn't going to be playing into Uber's core competancies. || Or Uber stays the exact same. Owners own the self driving cars and Uber is the backend keeping everyone in line and skimming off the top and bottom. Same as Airbnb. 

Im fully invested but I would start a position here. ||  I doubt, if Google would pay Uber, when they can very easily add this feature in Google maps. || I think this would be trivial for Google. They have their own API for maps. Uber at the end of the day is an app - a pretty mature one admittedly. But Google has a truckload of cash and they’ve created far more complicated stuff. They just didn’t want to commit resources to create a new Uber and would rather focus on improving and testing self driving tech.

So I’d guess this partnership remains the way it is now, it’s still a win win for both. Waymo gets to test their tech and not worry about marketing and attracting customers. Uber gets more profit.

I find it unlikely google or cruise would want to operate this on their own. It’s more complicated than make your own app. || Uber has operating leverage, Microsoft has it only barely.

Waymo has their own app but they partnered with Uber for the customer facing facility, because Uber has an established customer base and tech. Tesla will likely not integrate through Uber but it seems like Uber is the way to go for autonomous taxi providers to cut costs and focus on the tech. 

What I think is happening now is people hear about Tesla autonomous taxi and get scared. The tech is not there yet for Tesla, Waymo has done it with Lidar and choose to partner with Uber! Human taxis are not going anywhere, all it will take is one bad accident and people will be afraid.

Uber stock is the opposite of a recession hedge. Either buy Walmart/ Target or just get hotels/ hospitality stocks, based on your opinion. The taxi that one takes to go someplace is barely 5% of the travel budget. Of that 5%, Uber keeps 20% at best, between you and the driver. || Like this thesis a lot, I think Uber is very well positioned for the future. || That’s certainly the case, I think the recent deal was that Uber provides the cleaning/maintenance for the Waymo fleet and handle the customer side so Waymo literally only has to worry about the ride experience and tech. I’m bullish on Uber too || I am pricing them on the FCF growth || I think you missed the other part about oil dropping off a cliff. When oil prices are low the cost of travel is cheap and therefore people traveling = more business for Uber. || Very interesting thesis. You expect oil demand to plummet in the next six months due to some confluence of external factors, leading to a simultaneous travel boom localized to the US? || I'm a TA guy. The chart says oils going down fairly hard, but I don't know what exactly a news catalyst will be. The trade off is that with low oil prices people travel more - this is also bearish for Tesla. And with the majority of people struggling right now and having worked to make back what COVID took I think they all want a vacation, especially when it's cheap(er)."
Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",FortuneSoul,2024-11-20 04:41:27,9,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvawfq/trying_to_understand_the_mechanicsrisk_of_sgov_vs/,None,"Good questions, I also use SGOV to store my collateral for CSPs right now so I'm curious to check back for answers.  || Always very short term risk with them. If the rates suddenly go up, early in the month, that means the bond they bought at say 4.5 % could be bought at say a price of 5.5% because of a Fed hike for example, then the present value of those bonds could drop over 1% suddenly. They will still go up the 4.5 % by the end of the month. But you are open to a rare and short term price drop, especially early in the month. || >risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500

ETFs are structured to have 'creation units', which allow institutions to buy or sell blocks of the fund's securities to arbitrage any difference to NAV.  This forces the price to stay close to the NAV.  One sided buying or selling the ETF will not drive the price of an ETF like it would a stock 

>ETF Management Fraud

This is why funds have custodians and auditors.  A registered fund can't do a Bernie Madoff and lie about its holdings, because there are third parties verifying them.

>Black Swan Event

Treasuries are what investors would run towards in a financial crisis, so SGOV should do fine. || The effective duration of SGOV is 0.1 years.  So, if rates popped 1 percentage point overnight, the NAV of the fund would only drop 0.1% || This makes sense, however is there any risk from large ETF outflows like the Schwab rep made it sound?  I thought it would be protected due to being an open ended structure and the theory that the same underlying bond interest is being distributed among the shareholders so there should be an increase in amount of interest paid to a lower number of shareholders if many people exit the ETF at once since underlying is not changing?  Not sure I have this correct though... || If it is an ETF then I believe the shares are created and redeemed by Authorized Participants to profit and keep the share price in line with the index so there is no change in the ratio of interest payments per share.

The risk differences are that a money market has an implicit guarantee not to ""break the buck"" and it very very rarely happens so if you buy a dollar you can sell for a dollar, an FDIC savings account you will 'always' get your dollar back, a bond ETF composed of Treasuries you will get the interest on the bonds but you if you want to get your dollar back you will have to find someone to sell your share to for the same price you bought it for. They are all really low risk but if you look at a chart of the price of the ETF it isn't a dollar bought a dollar sold. || The risk is that some specific day it might go -.01%

And if you really need cash that one day you'll suffer Horribly!

Jokes aside. The salesman has no valid argument here. If you keep your cash there for more than a couple weeks the higher yield absolutely makes up for any mini volatility"

Ok I know this is utterly false.  Markets were cutting new daily ATHs for two months after myself and a very lonely minority were going to cash prior to COVID.  We were mocked at perma-bulls kept seeing those new daily highs even as other countries were turning into morgues.  It took kooky events including NBA to trigger them to flip.



> It feels weird and doesn’t make any sense.

As suspected, you’re going off “feels weird” and the other historical revisionism above.

As for it “doesn’t make sense”, there are actually very sensible explanations if one has a wider and better informed perspective.

Taking profits at the end of a massive up year isn’t some secret conspiracy, it’s normal.  Also, “billions” in selling isn’t large.  There’s billions in selling every day.  Also, do you realize when there’s “billions in selling” that by definition means there were counterparties doing “billions in *buying*”?

This will sound obvious, but think about it ‘how much you make on an investment depends on the price you pay’. There will still be some juice in this market for traders. But it’s no longer a buy and hold investment. Unless you are looking at 20 years plus. On a 10 year horizon you will have a better entry point and a better 10 year outcome. ‘Time in the market’ is peddled by people that make money from you being in the market. || Well only if you take it as gospel and act on only that.

People like Buffet are hoarding cash again because there will be a correction sometime in the near future. Then people will say see it's Trump. || Nope, it ripped because of Trumps corporate tax rate cuts which translates directly into earnings revisions so the market priced those in the same they will price them in again. || You better be 90% cash with advice like this, or at least up to your tits in puts.  

Recessions typically last 2 years or less in recent history.  If you can hold your investments for longer than a few years, you are always better off buying now than waiting for something that may never come. 

Being a long term investor is the only way a regular person can build meaningful wealth. Trying to trade in and out will ultimately lead to failure for most.

Even when you back out COVID spending, the national deficit increased substantially under Trump.


Again, you say you care about spending? 


Also there’s no contemplated pandemic spending in his next term’s proposals, so explain why the deficit is projected to increase substantially. || Wow, the level of economic and correlation vs. causation incompetence in this post is staggering. || lol you care about spending and inflation now?

Lol have you actually looked at how much the deficit increased under Trump?

Have you looked into how much the deficit will increase under his new proposals? || Bro. I hate to break it to you, but inflation is caused by too many dollars chasing two few goods. And maybe we should take a guess at which president printed 50% of all dollars ever created prior to his administration. Any guesses?

Do you understand what inflation is? 

Do you understand how the money supply affects inflation? 

Has nothing to do with a Republican or a Democrat || Biden had to bring down inflation caused by Trump's horrendous COVID response and unchecked spending, and he was successful, inflation has come down

If you want to pretend to care about spending, where is your criticism of Trump? He spends more than Biden, despite inheriting 2 great economies in his terms || I mean the trumpo administration has admitted they're going to tank the economy. He also has policy to bassically piss off all of the U.S trade partners so i mean theyre probably preparing for that. Not that stocks are not overvalued but they're dam mear planning to just death spiral the economy. || Yeah but once all the immigrants are gone white people still won't work, so earnings fuuuuuucked || Ok so which time were they wrong? A year ago when it was a third lower, or now? They can't both have been correct || Yup. || He’s trying to pull a “do your own research” while also making the claim… || Yeah?  Explain how please. Which point specifically am i getting wrong here

There are a million democrat shills here on reddit that will say anything to defend the party no matter how bad it gets and it’s BAD right now.  So say something that isn’t just a shallow empty statement that proves me wrong or that you aren’t just a dem shill || Don’t be a democratic shill 
/s || Facts don't care about my feelings. || I do understand what inflation is and there was no elevated inflation under the Trump administration.  Since you bring the printing up , he had no choice because of a pandemic that closed the country down I’m pretty sure you know this and your argument is deceptive and misleading but for the sake of argument he had no choice, Biden however gave out stimulus checks after everything was open and the economy was recovering.  Totally unacceptable I knew it even then and I’m not the only one.  

You are definitely viewing this through a keyhole and missing the big picture.  Biden continued to spend even after the fed had to increase interest rates to tame the inflation in effect fighting against what the fed was doing.  So yes I know what inflation is and Trump definitely contributed to it but he had little choice, Biden however did have a choice and continued spending anyway despite warnings from the fed, Jaimie Diamond and a shitton of other really really smart people who saw this getting out of control || Show me proof of where they said ""we're going to tank the economy"". Tell me some actual policies. || The comment of a child || Youre correct- i think it was wrong in 2022 (obviously) and correct this time, but we shall see || Dude was talking what he saw in the charts. A thought out response  would include data that confirms, denies or provides context. You went into a political rant and asked them to check again? Not sure what you’re trying to do in a stocks subreddit || Smell shoe shine on your own time || You talk about Biden spending and spending, yet Trump added 6 trillion to the us debt in his presidency. That’s 2 trillion more than Biden. The spending of 2020 was the biggest factor in the inflation of the Biden administration || Look at the M2 money supply. Bidens administration had to get it under control after Trump flooded the market with liquidity. || lol doing nothing but calling me a name - rather than disproving me 😂

Edit: oh my bad. Missed the sarcasm! || A simple “no I don’t understand” would have worked better. || I think he's referring to the blanket tarriff policies. Increased costs for imports = passed along to the consumer = less purchasing power = slowdown. || Congratulations! You voted for a person whose policies (tarrifs) you don't even understand (which we knew most of you didn't). 

You didn't read the words coming directly from his head of the newly formed DOGE: ""Donald Trump’s close ally and major economic adviser Elon Musk is warning supporters to expect economic chaos, a crashing stock market and financial “hardship” — albeit “temporary” — if Trump wins.

You don't understand basic economic concepts such as supply and demand and how when the WORLD opened pretty abruptly in 2021, demand was significantly higher than supply which allowed sellers of goods to charge whatever they wanted. You don't educate yourself to the fact that countries across the world had way worse inflation than us.

Why would we point out anything to you when you haven't been paying attention in the first place and we'd have to give you a government and economics lesson to boot? || It's been said more than once. Musk even said things would get worse before they got better. Meanwhile, they will loot and sell off our great grandparents' investments in society to their buddies for pennies on the dollar. It's gonna be rough. How are we seeing completely different narratives? || I paraphrased the word tank but it's not far off from what he himself has agreed with. https://www.fastcompany.com/91220386/some-temporary-hardship-elon-musk-admits-plan-with-trump-harm-economy || Tank the economy by lowering government spending by 2 trillion dollars seems like an esoteric approach. || Don’t even bother dude. 90% of Reddit needs to wash their brains… || His plan to just tarrif everything will definetly annoy all of our trade partners. || A smart child || They did it in Alabama (or Arkansas, you know, one of the family fucker states, I can’t remember which) in the 2010s - it didn’t go well at all, the “child” is right if you look at history. || That’s someone else and they said /s for sarcasm || I don’t think you understand that’s the problem.  I’ll go one better I don’t think you would admit to it even if it was crystal clear. According to you the fed and the ceo of the biggest bank in the world don’t know inflation is either or what caused it because they both said exactly what I’m saying now 😎

It’s not your fault people with TDS can’t help but blame him for everything even when it’s obvious it not there is no known cure || I’d actually say it’s more likely it’s referring to Elon and Vivek’s “program” and Elon saying we need to crash it hard to build something better and more sustainable out of it.

There’s a huge problem though here. They may say they want to cut 2 trillion in spending, but realistically if they want to try it just through executive and not Congress (who is unlikely to agree), they’re going to have lawsuits filed on them and I think this is too far for the Supreme Court. || Yea that's a fair argument but it's not even that bad. Government employees are going to get 2 years severance pay. If those people land another job they'd be doing great. 

The US government runs a huge deficit. Currently paying 1.2 trillion in annual interest. You either cut government spending or you keep getting inflation. || I gotta say I'm surprised there's this many idiots in stocks. They should be in stonks buying GME. || You mean China? He already did that in his first presidency. If it was so bad why didn't Biden remove any of it, instead they added more. || Not judging by that remark || Oops. Good catch. Thanks! || Critical thinking is the ability to draw your own conclusions from facts. Sounds like you get your conclusions drawn for you be some leftist big bank ceo. 

What makes you think “he had no choice?”. Cmon now, are you for real? He was the god damn president and there is always a choice. An actual conservative, which it sounds like you know nothing about, would never spent 8 trillion dollars *of deficit spending* on handouts. 

Your arguments fall right in line with mainstream media talking points. || Or you raise taxes instead of cutting them for corporations and the top earners. Cutting spending isn’t the only answer. || Because china added retalitory tarrifs the u.s cant just lift its tarrifs when china came back and had their own. Not just china mate pretty sure trump is on quote saying 20% tarrif on everything. || The tax cuts from 2017 expire in December of 2025, no? || That's what Biden did? || China's tarrifs doesn't hurt the US much. The US imports much more products from China than it exports. This is not a left or right policy. It's across party lines. And will be going forward as the US decouples from China. Manufacturing is already headed to other parts of Asia. Any old factories from an old Japanese or Korean manufacturer is going to get dumped and rebuilt I'm a different country. The western alliance needs to keep China from rising to the top.

His 20% tarrif grand scheme is to remove income tax and just use tarrifs.  Which is not going to happen. He wants to bring back manufacturing to the US to please his base. I believe there is some plan to have little to no tax for American made products."
DoJ wants to Breakup Google,"Bloomberg reported in the after hours that DoJ wants to push Google to sell Chrome
Chrome due to search Monopoly. The DoJ wants to ask the Judge (Mehta) to force Google. What do we think about it?

What the hell have I just read || Haha sell chrome

What is this 1993 and they’re doing the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit…. ? || So basically nothing happens, sell Chrome, and the new company uses Google default anyway? || If chrome makes money, it's by directed people to Google search and YouTube and Gmail and Drive, and Google Play etc where Google can data collect and sell stuff. Not really an appealing business to have a web browser product without the search engine bussing to default users to. Just tank Chromium development funding and give a new avenue for Firefox to make a strong comeback || Just selling Chrome Browser is not bad at all.

Honestly, not even a scratch. || First of all, doubt it will happen.

Second, why now rather than 15 years ago?

Third, is “chrome” - arguably their least integrated product - even enough to make a dent in anything let alone call it a breakup?

Fourth, remember the Microsoft case… || Isn't Chromium open source? They could then just launch Google Chromium which is the exact same thing... || Isn't the new administration coming in a few months? I am not saying Trump won't continue down the same path. But shouldn't the current administration just leave these important decisions to their successor? Is it just a symbolic move so that they can claim it's my legacy?

That aside, I don't understand the decision of selling Chrome. A browser by itself is hardly a viable business. Just look at Mozilla. Wouldn't it make more sense to break out Android and Play? Folks at DOJ probably don't really know how to operate a business. || Good time to buy GOOG right now! They will be 3T market cap in the next couple of years. This case is simply noise, US Gov wont ever forcibly breakup a US based mega cap tech company, too much lobbying, helps China and a breakup ultimately doesn't make money. Go look at GOOG finances, company is unbelievable, up in almost every sector. They have an army of lawyers, will appeal for years, worst come worst one of the proposals was making users select their choice of internet browsers when they first buy a device... then they just select Google Lmfao what a joke. || Sell to whom? Any potential parties interested in buying? || lol Chrome of all things. If they wanted to go for the jugular they could’ve gone for YouTube or even Cloud. Nothing will happen || Lol. Hey you are too good. You must sell.

I thought this was America || all that for a drop of blood. || My 190 december calls are cooked... || DoJ have certainly proved their wisdom in these matters in their recent virtual execution of Spirit and likely dooming of the budget domestic flight market || This is one of those reddit threads where you realize how dumb reddit is as a whole.

You don't know how chrome works as a business model. Clearly you don't recognize the significance of it. 

The markets reacted this way because if they are going for chrome they have no chance at meeting the anti trust requirements to make it happen. || This is standard background noise.

It doesn’t hurt the company or stock.

Buy.


Next, 47 comes into office the DOJ will drop any case like this. || for fuck's sake, every week it's something with google, can't catch a break || This won’t happen and the DOJ is out sooo let’s just move along here || Honestly, that might be good for Google. Split off their newer cutting edge future tech from the old boring low revenue stuff. Personally, I’d love to get shares of Waymo. (Assuming Musk doesn’t kill it.) || Yawn. The Department of Injustice will lose. || If they really wanted to break up google they’d separate porn searches and whatever the other people search for. || Sundar Pichai 100 million donation to trump incoming. || DOJ did shit against Trump and Musk alike because they are too powerful. So they just bully google instead || Even if it happens it will take years and there will be no material impact on Alphabet other than legal fees. If it does eventually happen the sum of the parts might actually benefit investors.

That said, there will be a new boss at the DOJ soon, and they very well might kill this,. || From all the Magnificent 7, Google is the only one that developed really useful, practical products that made life easier for people; think about Google Maps, Google Translate besides of course their search engine. This only helps the other big-tech monopoly companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta) to destroy a rival || I hate this, I love chrome, it integrates well with all the Google services I use. Plus, chrome would never exist if Google did not fund it and make it into a market leader through merit, against stacked odds btw. 

Remember Microsoft had the browser market on lock and still to this day tries to sneakily make it the default every chance it gets, having built it using google chromes open source code no less. All the cases against Google are BS and should be dropped. This is a prime example of big government Marxists who’ve never run a lemonade stand attacking anything successful. Enough! || Whole new administration coming, all bets are off at doj run by a pedo gaetz || Chrome Chrome noooo || Biden antagonizing big tech proved to be pretty stupid going into an election cycle. Too powerful. Trump will probably cut a deal with Google to squash this. || There goes my goog shares…. || The likelihood that this results in a forced divestiture of Chrome is very low for a lot of reasons. For starters, they do not have the only search engine. Bing may suck, but it is owned by Microsoft which is in fact a bigger company than Google by market cap - so they could definitely compete if it mattered to them - DuckDuckGo also produces the same thing. The competition which DuckDuckGo offered with their lack of tracking even demonstrates differentiation exists in the market.

Moreover, Google AdWords (their search product) can be manually created on websites by selling ad space to sponsors & placing an ad without the network of Google's platform. Outbrain does similar spots.

Technically speaking, more broadly, search ads are just ""digital marketing"" which also exists on social media, or email. SMS, streaming, etc. are all alternatives to Google.

Hell, television & radio can also be places businesses spend money on promotions.

Also, SEM (Google search result ad locations) are not inherently valuable for other businesses whereas they are more beneficial for certain industries like legal firms.

Microsoft pioneered this whole fake monopoly act in the 90's. All it does is signals to the market that the stock is worth more than it is today, ads speculation which drives the options markets, and ultimately gives the big business a chance to write or re-write the laws. || All I see are call or put holders shilling their positions in this post 😂 || Chrome is the baby of Pichai, he would never sell it lol || Seems a lot better for Google than it could be || I’m buying more stock tomorrow || What’s next ? They will ask Microsoft to sell Windows ? Meta to selll WhatsApp? || Amazon next || Buying if it hits 160 again..again. || It says “Chrome Chrome” || Plot twist:  it will never break down || I read this as: buy OPRA stock.

Stock is below intrinsic value and with all that noise it is gonna skyrocket. || Microsoft could totally ass fuck Google in its most vulnerable stage by discontinuing Bing and making it black and white that Google has dominance in Search engine market. || Of all the things, splitting off Chrome is not going to make a difference at all. || What will happen to Chromebooks? I love mine and hope Google will keep making them. || I don't understand? Was Microsoft forced to sell Internet Explorer? Did they ask Apple to sell Safari? || The latest from Trump was that google shouldn't be broken up. That technologies like that is a bulwark against China.


But he wants the algorithm changed as he claims it was negative towards him.


Is that not factored in?  || What a coincidence, just yesterday I said ""that's never gonna happen"" || Good, they never should have been able to buy Youtube and ruin it. || Trump is reinforcing the isolationism into economy. Google is a monopoly and they are obedient compared to many others. Should or would they force them to break up significantly? I doubt it. || The end where it is suggested OpenAI could purchase Chrome is such a joke. Seems ironic considering the reason for the push to break up GOOGL. || Maybe this wood have happened in a Kamala presidency.  In a Trump one?!?!  lol. || A bit dumb, imo. Why should a company give something they worked hard for away. Why don't they ask for instagram and amazon as well || Something tells me they won’t be lol || Makes sense. Anytime I googled anything about the election it was just borderline defamation of DJT. They should be broken up indeed || I think both Google and Meta should be broken up || ""Okay what about all the other monopolies.""


""Nooooooooooo"" -Conservative Judge || Filthy spying controlling mo'fo's..

..I'm referring to Google, not DoJ.

Google has broken every single copyright and privacy law since its inception ..but because anybody who stood up to them got de-listed from their search, which would leave their business dead in the water ..so everyone had to put up with the illegal nature of their business model.

A quote from one of the founders, just moments before launch: ""We are going to make a lot of money or we are going to spend a long time in jail"" || If this goes anything like how Microsoft went then it isn’t going to happen || Now lets be honest is this a surprise, it is the definition of a natural monopoly at least in my opinion. || Forced to sell to whom, Elonia??? || What is Chrome? Chrome OS and Chromebook? Or chrome browser? It should be YouTube if any || I don’t use Google. So there’s no monopoly. || Who would’ve thought r/stocks is filled with people who have no understanding of the foundations of antitrust law and capitalism. Oh wait, everyone || Who gives a fuck... they'll obviously appeal || It would be massive if they were to sell youtube and break the creator economy. || Which DoJ? Just stall till Matt Gaetz gets in and send over some girls... Problem solved. || Google probably won’t have to do anything. iPhones have safari default. That alone can show they don’t own the browser space and people have choice for search engine. Also chrome allows other search engines for default. || It's not a monopoly though || With all the nonsense going around, the next thing we here will be that Trump is going to order Meta and Google to accept Elon Musk as their lord and savior. || I own a lot of GOOG/GOOGL and I'd actually love to see them broken up and get shares of all of the parts. 

But just selling off Chrome seems pointless. It's just a browser and doesn't work any better with the rest of Google's services than Firefox or Safari or Edge do. 

The only real ""unfair advantage"" they get from owning Chrome is that they don't have to pay themselves to be the default search provider. IIRC they pay Firefox a ton of money to use Google search by default (and they pay Apple even more, by orders of magnitude). If Chrome is split off, they would pay Chrome's new company a ton of money to use Google search by default. || Would be excellent if the stock falls tomorrow on this news. Would gladly accumulate. || This is so stupid, Microsoft has the most dominate OS system Windows, which has Edge as the default browser, which has Bing as the default search engine. They have the full stack yet Edge and Bing are not dominate and there is a reason, they are the inferior products. I've been using Bing for the last two weeks because of their million dollar giveaway and its absolutely garbage.

Also Google open sourced Chromium that other browser are built off of and can be built off of so its not like they have some monopoly on browser technology || And add term limits while you’re at it. || Could definitely shake up Google’s dominance if it happens || that's stupid, make them sell android or play store || [deleted] || Makes absolute sense. Chrome AND Youtube are monopolies. Monopolies are really REALLY bad for consumers and we saw what kind of deranged power they accumulate when left unchecked. || It's zuck in a mustache and wig || Lmfao. Michael Shoft is also on the case. || Lol poetic || Apparently Judge Chadra Jipiti had a conflict of interest and was dismissed || Indian Zuckerberg || Very common Indian name || FYI - “Mehta” is pronounced as meh + tha 

I.e. “h” in meh is NOT silent and the “ta” at the end is smooth like in “th”ank and NOT like in “ta”rget) || That should honestly be the name of Meta || Zuck snuck the h in.. hoping we wouldn’t notice || Sus || This has been looming all year. If anything it will go up since it’s just chrome || Priced in || Trump will reduce the trust busting so it's not a big deal. || Trump admin is gonna make all the tech antitrust go away. || This is all they are talking about doing? The Stock will go up. || happy cake day, cake day buddy! || It doesn’t matter because the current administration is incompetent and ineffective.  || Yeah, I don't even understand what selling Chrome even means. I can see stop developing or distributing it externally, but while the Chromium open source project exists, who would ""buy"" Chrome itself? || Lmao so 'sell Chrome' was actually their *compromise* position? These antitrust folks are wild || Trivia: Chrome was the first Google product whose external name was the same as its internal name, and Android was the second. || These judges are pathetic they can’t do any of that … Google would appeal and they would be dead by the trial || I mean it makes sense because a dedicate Chrome business would work well considering how many people want to *pay* for web browsers! /s

Give it to Mozilla! || They should make MS sell edge as well shouldnt they? || We are forced to use chrome at work.  And teams.    So it double sucks. || Exactly they are so pathetic || Pretty sure they will also try to stop Google from being able to buy default status from anyone. || Firefox itself is struggling with funding. So far I have yet seen a viable profitable standalone browser company at scale. || Chrome is maybe the single biggest intangible asset that Google has. If Google is forced to sell, it would be bad for their investors.

Are you loaded with Alphabet puts lol || Chrome is huge. Chrome recently stopped supporting uBlock Origin so Google can force more ads down our throats || They're trying to break up a monopoly, not a conglomerate. It's not illegal to be a conglomerate. Owning YouTube isn't preventing competition in search. Owning the most popular web browser and having that browser set your search engine as the default option does prevent competition in search. || Why would the US government go for the jugular of a big US company?

Sundar climbed the ranks from chrome || This is America.  Antitrust laws are extraordinarily important for a number of reasons, but perhaps most important, to ensure competition (which leads to innovation) and consumer protection -- whether or not these laws are correctly implemented in any given case is a different story || Yes and no.

Capitalism absolutely needs competition to be healthy since monopolies hurt consumers.

The problem in Google’s case is that they have had plenty of competition over the years. Google beat them fair and square.

In a lot of ways you are right Google shouldn’t be punished for that.

DoJs time is better spent preventing companies from buying out their fledgling competitors.

I don't think the DOJ has enough resources to fight 2 tech giants at the same time. Also it's not easy to argue that Meta has a monopoly on anything. On the other hand, that is rather easy to do with Google. || According to the article is just the browser || Chrome is maybe the single biggest intangible asset that Google has.

From NYT: “either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or bar Google from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the government could force the company to sell Android at a later date. In a sweeping filing, the government also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on smartphones and in browsers. Google should also be required by the court to allow rival search engines to display the company’s results and access its data for a decade, the government said.”  

The part about Apple is ridiculous and a major over reach in my opinion. Apple should be allowed to sell exclusivity. It should go to the highest bidder. If another browser can’t afford to bid, get some PE backing if the ROI is so promising. 

I don’t even get the last part about rival search engines displaying Google search results for a decade. That would mean they get to use Google algorithms for a decade??

All of this I understand…we are in uncharted waters for companies this big. But there is a massive ecosystem of shareholders and partner companies that could be decimated by this (me being one…my ability to retire is heavily reliant on Google stock value in the future). So who is really getting punished here and who is really benefiting….? || Trump also said he disliked how Google favored the democratic party previously so they might not be safe.  I say this with google being my largest single holding and a complete belief they’re criminally undervalued based on fundamentals and future innovation.  But I’m not optimistic this will all just go away with a new administration || This trial started under previous Trump administration. || why would he? Big-tech was vocally liberal. Payback time! || This is interesting. There is a decent chance Trump will actually do this. The antitrust is priced in already so any positives on this for Google would be good for the stock price. || I thought MAGA hated big tech. || Some Google exec with a fake mustache claiming to Be Mr Juan Carlos from Chrome Lowriders. || It's relevant. The chrome you have is different software from the open source Chromium. Each keystroke, page visit carefully anonymized, mapped to certain target themes and topics, to show you relevant ads across YT, Maps, search.. 


Try it. Use both browsers on your device as unregistered user. In chrome, look for pet shops, pet care, and watch what ads you see across Google. In Chromium, try a different topic (e.g. buy car). You will likely won't see car ads as much. || These antitrust folks are years late. This isn’t wild at all. || I dont get the significance || Mozilla pretty much only exists because Google pays them to be the default search provider......sooooooooooo || Only possible way is to also ban others. Then in that case, Google still wins as they now just don't have to pay. || The EU already has regulation which prohibit those default statuses.
  https://www.androidpolice.com/the-eu-new-default-browser-rules-work/ || They could just go back to working with Mozilla to creating new standards.

can't quite tell if you're for or against the breakup lol. Something seems eerily anti competitive about a company being able to 'push the future of the internet' in their interests

> Don't get me wrong, they could squeeze a few bucks out of it, but it wouldn't be worth the price multiple at sale for the degradation of Google's competitive advantage.

so you're basically saying that if this was the same product by anyone else it wouldn't be worth as much? that sounds like a bubble to me frankly || They'd just make another Chrome || google sells ads not web domination. 

The EU has been forcing people to choose search engine for a decade, and the percentage of google search is even higher  in EU than rest of world || You basically described why they should be made to sell it. 


Cornering the market isn't good for anyone but them. || Chrome is native to Android and is necessary for them to prevent losing markets hare in search on mobile. Losing Chrome will fundamentally restructure googles business || It sets Google as the default browser || Ironically, Google gave me this result:

Advertising

* Google Chrome automatically sets Google as the default search engine, which leads to more ads being served to users. Google also sells ad space on other Google products, like Maps and YouTube, and on partner sites and apps. 

Using related Google services

* Users who use Chrome are more likely to use other Google services, like Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Apps. These services are highly integrated, so each time a product is used, page views increase and ad revenue increases. 

Tracking user data

* Chrome tracks user data to improve Google's AdSense program. Advertisers bid to show in ad spaces in a real-time auction, and the highest paying ads appear on the site. || plugin store? || I would be in trouble because yahoo fucking sucks as a search engine || I miss 2006 era YouTube || Youtube was founded 2005 and acquired 2006 though it would not report income separately until recently by 2009 it was clearly a monopoly by itself. || Edge is already Chromium based || Firefox endorses googles management decisions. || uBlock Lite works fine though || Is it googles fault that people choose to use chrome willingly then? The default browser on windows is edge, and the default browser on apple is safari. No one’s forcing people to download chrome. Why is it monopolistic if Google pushes their own search product on chrome? Isn’t that intuitive and natural for any company? How about Apple having their own AppStore on all iPhones and devices? Or windows having bing as its default search on edge?

This is just like saying windows computers and laptops having the search engine set to bing as default is anti-competitive, and hence should be stopped as well, even though in actuality no one uses bing cause it’s bad. Seriously ridiculous because this move by DOJ just seems results-oriented more than anything because of the fact that majority of people willingly choose to use googles browser. It sets a dangerous precedent if DOJ wins. || You can set the browser as whatever you want 

You can set the search engine as whatever you want || How is that Google fault?  Blame the competitors for sucking.  Chrome is a shit product, I rather use FF because it has better option to block Google ads.  But I will still use Google over duck or bing for search.

Consumers love monopoly because a monopoly means the company is the top competitor and the default winner. Look at Steam.  What’s the point in using other inferior launcher?  Same with MS OS.  Why learn niche OS while enterprise systems will continue to use Win XP instead? || Neither can chrome || Actually it was Android || They had competition, which was where they shined, but now that the competiton is gone... || Speaking of telecoms companies, I think we’re well overdue talking a look at cable.

That is a literal monopoly, as most can’t choose an alternative. || That’s different. He’s just mad that you can’t drop the n-bomb on facebook and I don’t think forcing Meta to sell off facebook is how they’d go about changing that. || [deleted] || I’d agree but Trump and Proj 2025 are not related from a sense that it’s his work or that he commissioned it. || Anti big tech because of censorship and anti business are two different things || As is the incoming vice president || They is odd. Does not make sense. If Android makes more sense. || A Zuck a day keeps the mankind away || Also Nate Felix || I don't get it || He also mentioned that he doesn’t want China to beat US and would be careful of breaking it up. || He is obsessed with the market and will be weary to do anything that would shake it up. || China. He’s made it very clear he wants to fight Chinas rise with anything possible, main reasons he’s going back to fossil fuels, tariffs, low regulations. || Thats why they have been slowly warming up to Trump. Bezos blocked the WaPo endorsement of Harris, Zuck talked about how heroic Trump looked after the failed assassination. Not to mention the millions in donations to each party to hedge bets || Big Tech is here to stay, otherwise the US will end up being 3 decades behind China in AI tech. || Does ublock with anti tracking protect you or is this kind of tracking too much baked into chrome? || IDK I think the way the EU has done it is better. It’s obviously not fair if the world’s search engine also has a browser that defaults to use their search engine. But if the company is building a great product, you also don’t want to take that from the user. To solve, just don’t allow the browser to automatically set the default search and have it ask the user. I think that’s the best outcome for consumers || This || I think you're hinting that if Google doesn't have Chrome this means more cash for Mozilla?

It's AMAZING how much money the execs at Mozilla have just pocketed with literally no innovation. It's a complete scam. || This. Banning companies from buying the default search will only help Google in my opinion. || Which if you look at search engine market share. It had zero impact on Google. Because no other search engine can be the default. || I don't even really like Chrome, but killing Chrome would be terrible for the Web at this point. Then who is left? Just Firefox and Safari? || You wouldn't but millions potentially nearly billions of people do just use the default. || It is called vertical integration. A bubble is something else entirely. || I think Google having this much control over the internet is a bad thing for the internet. I bought google shares and a few other companies because I don't want to be a serf. I agree with the DOJ that this breakup sounds like a good thing for the internet but a bad thing for my google position.

It's not a bubble. It's worth more to google because of the intangible value to google. If it was an independent company it would have nothing to gain by pushing google search or google drive onto you, and their power to decide what will go into web APIs would have a lot less value. || That's correct || But search tab is more important.  Like I use safari on phone, but my search tab is Google.  Same thing with FF on PC, Google search.  I don’t use chrome because it has less extensions than FF.  

Chrome can die off and nothing of value will be lost if Google search bar is the default.  I think Google should dump it off to MS for $100-200B to trick them in buying Chrome.  Everyone will set their search bar to Google either way.  Even Apple knows this, and the default browser is Safari that everyone uses due to default privacy and ads block. || You reveal an important point. Yahoo used to rule the search engine market. Who’s to say Google search will be able to retain dominance in search for the next four years even if the Trump cabal leaves it alone? || I sure as hell don't miss the era of dial-up speeds and 360p videos. || Because they make 90% of their money from..Google || That’s a gimped version || Why do you think fault is a factor here? Monopolies hinder competition and competition leads to innovation.

What would really fix the sector is the DOJ stopping the rampant and complete pilfering of user data. || Why do you think fault or blame are factors here? They are not.

Educated consumers do not love monopolies. Monopolies stifle innovation and make it near impossible for any other entity to compete which is bad for innovation, bad for the economy bad for anyone who wants to start a business. The problem is that it is extremely difficult for a consumer to be fully educated on every product they use in their lives. 

The idea of breaking up monopolies is that if the product is so good it should be able to compete fairly without the benefits of a monopoly. It's pretty depressing that this needs to be explained. || Streaming has basically killed cable. Once all the boomers are gone cable will not exist anymore. || The problem is that the current bs are all former bells lol. Like they broke them up, slowly got bought up and now it’s at&t (they got bought by cingular) vs verizon. The only bells that made it were Cincinnati bell and frontier which is pending a sale to verizon lol. || Cable will be dead in a decade. No oversight is needed || Youtube TV || Lmao || He's close with many that worked on p2025 || You're right, Android or YouTube would make a lot more sense imo. || Ma! I'm out of Rozucks || Can't forget about En Vida || “Chat gpt” 🤣 || I mean I’m not selling anytime soon - might even add more.  Browser, search, video media, fsd.  10%+ top line growth, crazy fcf.  There’s no better investment out there from an alpha perspective imo || Same thing happens with 60% tariffs on AI hardware. Everything trump says conflicts so that everyone gets to hear what they want to hear. || I should experiment with that. No idea TBH. 


But cookies aside, there're so many ways to track a user or the 'household'. IP address and browsing history would be the easiest. Then, so many people have the habit of staying logged in to their google account, it's so easy to ""chase"" you across devices. || Except Google optimize its sites for better experience in Chrome. 

And every fucking time I go to a Google site with Edge, I have to click a pop up saying that I don't want to change to chrome and edge is a chromium browser itself. || No, because unless they’ve moved on from it, several governments have been going after them for paying to be the default search engine too. 

I know nothing of the financials of Mozilla but they make a free product and aren’t Google, Apple, or Microsoft so idk what you expect.  || Yeah, I mean already happening in EU, you had to choose the default search engine from a random list. And guess what, people select Google, because chances are, 90% of the population don't even recognize anything other than Google & Bing. || Yeah, basically nobody wants to develop a browser, must be a lot of work. || You mean Blink, Webkit, and Gecko right? || Well they could just create a new fork of Chromium and call it ""Google Browser"" || I truly am the only one that likes Edge, arent I? || Edge baby || Arc || I literally can’t find what I’m looking for on Bing. I don’t know how it can be this bad after it’s existed for so long || I'm pretty sure default is Google on safari, although I don't own an iPhone. Although doesn't Google pay apple hundreds of millions for that? 

Also if the default search bar were not Google, I think a lot of older people would just leave it. And Google would lose a lot of money. || >  I think Google should dump it off to MS for $100-200B to trick them in buying Chrome.

Selling Chrome to Microsoft doesn't seem like a good way to reduce monopolies though... || Google is a verb these days. There's no way it's losing relevance anytime soon. It's a giant. || That what I said when google had their IPO in 2004 (apart from the bit about Trump.)

I was very very wrong. || Having dial up in 2006 must have sucked. || What I’m arguing is that there’s nothing inherently anti-competitive about Google pushing their own search on chrome, because chrome in the first place isn’t forced on consumers in any way. DOJ’s solution of going for chrome just seems to be an artificial way to hinder the company rather it being a legitimate response to any fundamentally anti-competitive practice.

It’s a slippery slope. If the DOJ can break up companies at any whim, why would anyone even innovate anymore? || Except almost every single company that was broken up and turned into smaller companies STILL maintained their monopoly so idk what benefit you speak of. Or need i remind you how SLOW the rollout of fiber was/is bc of a certain telecom duopoly that used to be………. The same Monopoly.

Where exactly were the innovations and customers friendliness there? || Ari Cal is there! || I use edge at work and have not encountered that error. 
It doesn’t show up when I search with google either. || It's only free because Google pays for it || A lot of work and basically no profits. Web browsers are just software utilities at this point. That's why every major browser has to be subsidized instead of generating direct revenue. Unless people want to see browsers with embedded ads instead of ad blockers... || Webkit really needs to just die. Urgh. Horrible to work with and so many problems. It's literally like dealing with IE6 again at times.

We got so many issues with our website that were exclusive to iOS/Safari, especially around text clipping/fonts due to Webkit shenanigans. || Lol that would be kind of funny if that worked || Edge is based on Chrome, if Chrome died then Edge probably would too. || Edge is based on Chromium, they probably eventually go down if Chrome does. || Arc is based on Chromium, if Chrome dies then all of the Chromium browsers lose their main developer.

Also I just looked, Arc is apparently being abandoned lol. So probably not a good option regardless. || 20 billion to be exact || Oh, I’m not saying it’s going away. But it won’t stay the absolute dominant search engine forever. We are already seeing ChatGPT functions as a search engine. What amazing new tool is still in the lab that we don’t know about? || Compared to today's speed : price value, the sht offered back in 2006 might as well be dial up. || >If the DOJ can break up companies at any whim

They can't. Google had the opportunity to defend themselves in court--the judge ruled it was a monopoly in August. I suggest you read their opinion [here.](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f6ab5c368725101c/43d7c2a0-full.pdf) || I heard judge Tui Terr wanted to break up Musk’s X || Or the fact that it's open-source || That's a lot of my point. If Google stops paying Mozilla (or anyone for that matter) there might not be a Mozilla. Chromium is open source too and has major backing. I don't see much support for Firefox, and as a user this bums me out. Chrome is the new IE. A lot of sites have just stopped checking their sites in Firefox. || It's open source. It's free because no one owns the code.  || How is Facebook staying the dominant social network forever? || Nah, I had already been playing MMOs like WoW for years by then. It wasn’t a sore spot because it was all we knew and it was way better than the *true* dial up years. || Judge Blu Skye was my dominatrix as her side hustle!"
Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”)

...

>After receiving additional information through the Review process, **EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management** in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and **whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee**. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning **due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management**, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”

What your take on FMNA/FMCC?,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it’s a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally. 

Today’s sentiment by the trump administration is to release them from conservatorship. It could be a 20-50x pps jump next year.

Exercising these warrants would require ending the conservatorship, and allowing them to expire seems highly out of character for Trump. || Very risky. Who knows what Trump will do || Unlikely. A release from conservatorship will hurt too many people across all parts of the political spectrum. Also, they will be forced to compete with everyone else and will not do well.

Quote from their original research from 2017:
>While privatization may seem desirable in terms of protecting taxpayers, the functional reality is that the
GSEs today perform functions that the private markets are unwilling to provide, at least at current levels
of mortgage interest rates and equity returns. As mentioned above, the GSEs take market and credit risk
that private investors have so far been unwilling to bear. With respect to the credit risk, today there is no
significant market for taking first loss risk on single family mortgages other than prime loans held in
portfolio on the balance sheets of depository institutions. || Why the huge price run in last 60 days? || I also bought this before the election with a similar thesis. I clearly, however, bought way too little. || Same discussion was brought up last time when Trump was first elected. The Secretary of Treasury at the time said on TV that he was going to release Fannie and Freddie but it ended up being a nothing burger. I know a lot of people lost money betting on that trade. Some speculated that they discussed Fannie and Freddie on purpose so that big boys who bought the stocks way back then can get out. The better play is the preferred shares which they need to be redeemed at par or be converted to common stocks. However, volume is extremely low. || So I agree with you that they would go up in value a lot if the government control changes. But it’s really a big play on whether Trump will push for it. 

It’s possible but will he really push for it? It’s not like it’s a hot button issue for his base.  On the other hand on the list of things he could do it’s probably not that hard to push for. 

I predict he just plays golf and focuses on other things instead. || Trump || Trump didn't release them from conservativeship or even talk about it when he was president. Why will this term be different?"
Hold off on investing until February?,"Is anybody working a wait-and-find-out strategy with investing right now?

With the election and geopolitics being what they are and the markets going up and down, I’ve heard some murmurs that everything is about to come crashing down. If that’s the case, I would just want to hold what I have and then begin building again from that point forward. 

Does it make sense to keep working DCA at this point? Some prices are low, but could potentially drop way lower (thinking about VOO).

I know you can’t time the market and speculation isn’t a science.",Employee28064212,2024-11-20 18:15:48,0,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvoo6f/hold_off_on_investing_until_february/,None,"I can only tell you once we get to February if this was a good idea. || Better to just invest the same amount weekly or monthly no matter the price. 

Time in market > timing the market || there will always be a reason to not invest. let's go through the past 5 years

2020: covid

2021: covid variants

2022: inflation/ukraine war

2023: inflation/ukraine war

2024: election year

  
total return over these 5 years is over 100%

blah blah blah. just invest and forget about it || You can’t time the market but you can assess your own risk tolerance and timeframes. I’m personally starting to pare back some investments and hold more cash and have put off investing life in my taxable accounts. I expect heavy volatility, and I’m also sitting on gains which I can afford to harvest and repurpose (either into a market dip or into other projects). Bottom line is I think this might be a good time for folks to assess their strategies, check their liquidity positions and adjust if needed || no. i invest year round. and i take profits every quarter and i sell losers with a callous efficiency. || Asking myself the same question. I’ve been partitioning my biweekly investments into VTI and some long term bond funds. This doesn’t feel like the time to be aggressive. Just a sentimental take of n=1 from a random redditor. || No not good to wait. You can’t determine when to get in , the markers are always uncertain 

Invest now, invest wisely and take chances. || Yep, kind of. I've sold most of my sp 500 when it was at the highest recently and bought some safe (as much as something can be safe) French stocks (I'm French). I also bought some cryptos at the beginning of their craze, so that's cool.


My reasoning is: I think that if Trump applies his ideas, it's gonna be disastrous for the US economy. So, two possibilities:

- He applies his ideas, the US economy takes a hit, I'm happy I made this decision.

- Something happens (or I'm wrong) and the US economy doesn't take a hit... Well, I'll rejoice! Maybe I will have lost some potential growth but I'd rather lose some potential money and not see the US - and the world - have a really really bad couple of years.


So in a way, it's a win win. I'm not the FOMO kind, so I'll be sincerely happy if it all turns out for the best. || Wait and find out means you'll be buying in at a higher price if the future looks good and a lower price of it looks bad. The market largely accounts for risk, so in reality, you're not gaining anything. || The best time to buy is always yesterday OP || Market is sketchy and cash is a position. I think anyone thats not worried about a recession or at least hedging is a fool.  || The geopolitical situation of the world has never been great from the high standards that people seem to have recently adopted, comparing the global situation to some vague utopian idea of the past that never existed. We have more information of world events now and are being constantly bombarded with it, and I think people confuse this with the world being a more unsafe place than it was in the past.

Things can always dip lower, that’s the nature of the game. Up to you if you want to neglect looking for good value companies for a few months, but people constantly have gut feelings that something bad is going to happen to the market or the world, and occasionally they do but acting on those feelings is generally not a good idea. || Markets are already heading down thanks to the Tariff talk. || Nobody knows.

Why would it drop with trump in office? It didn’t when he was in office before. || I’m just putting my money in gold stocks for now. At least if there is a market boom I’d make gains. If there is a recession, I’ll also profit as well. The market sentiment right now I feel is for everyone to buy as much stocks as you can before the inauguration as the whole market will repeat Covid levels. If everyone is expecting it the opposite usually happens. I am counting on the entire market steadily increasing until January at ATH’s, then a huge drop off come February. I’ll probably sell anything other than gold stocks at that point then buy back when it all tumbles. We also can not forget that Putin might try something desperate or Iran blocking the suiz canal that will inflate the oil market and tear up the whole market apart. || Yes, just DCA. I think going balls in would be a mistake, see investors in 2021 who got shafted. || I’m in the market daily. Seeing some fairly reliable stocks nosedive just made me question if I should take a break for a minute haha.

I can’t imagine being bullish on anything right now. || The market can only account for known/apparent risk.  || [deleted] || Agreed. The pompous overconfidence that comes up in discussions like this is always wild to me lol. || Is gold a reasonable cash alternative? || Our incoming president and Elon would also love to see some massive drops in order to buy things back up for pennies. Thats what Elon meant when he talked about crashing it in order to build it back up. || He was in office in 2020 and 2018 wasnt a good year || One word: tariffs. That leads to recession. || No you won’t || You're not investing, you are trading. You need to re-evaluate your risk tolerance if red days make you question your investments. || So you invest daily but are unsure why stocks go down sometimes? || 2022…?? So yeah we had a massive sell off 2/5 years. As I said, still total return of over 100% || Ah? My 2022 meta position would like to have a word || Read OPs post lol || But that doesn't change the fact that the unknowns are just as likely to boost stocks as it is to weaken stocks. || True! Thank you for the feedback || What about it? SQ, docusign all pumped during Covid too. I’m not gonna cherry pick. The market, S&P sold off.

Did you diamond hand through 2022?!?!? || That was my point. You said the market only tanked during COVID and that's not true. 2022 saw a massive dip across the board || Yeah forgot about that one lol"

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

They're on track to be trading at 21-22x 2024 net income. They report in ""adjusted earnings"" which basically backs out SBC. The SBC accounts for about $0.08/share annually at this point, so not nothing, but not huge. 

If they hit their stated goal of 20% growth next year that puts them around 17-18x 2025 earnings, which should be around $2.18/share. [Stock analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/odd/forecast/) shows the consensus 2025 earnings at $1.69/share so there is a potential mispricing there, and by a large amount. 

They also have several new products slated to be released in late 2025 so it's very possible we see accelerated growth beyond that. 

The company also is buying back stock, which lessens the impact of the SBC. Ideally there would be less SBC and they could actually lower the share count, but for such a young company, I don't consider this a deal breaker. || Is this finally the pull back on LB?

This is an example of a screener I use: 

[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa\_estltgrowth\_o10%2Cfa\_peg\_u2%2Cfa\_quickratio\_o1%2Cfa\_roi\_o10%2Cfa\_salesqoq\_o5&ft=2&o=industry](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa_estltgrowth_o10%2Cfa_peg_u2%2Cfa_quickratio_o1%2Cfa_roi_o10%2Cfa_salesqoq_o5&ft=2&o=industry)

I just start out with things like sales growth QoQ over 5%, since a lot of companies are seeing some slowdowns but still want to buy something that has sales growth. I like look at EPS growth over 5 years to see how good the management of the company is. 

I like high ROC so always start out with like 10% or change it to 15%. Personally I like companies with quick ratios over 1, so always start with that. 

I also like trying to get things a good price, so I start out looking with a PEG of under 2.

Way too much investment into this one stock for it to fail. || Just wish I had bought more than 34 shares

My hope is. that if Nvidia kills it tomorrow, Meta might get out of its funk. || Nvidia has definitely considered Cerebras full-wafer direction. I have no idea what their conclusions were besides the fact that if they thought it was the right move they'd be doing it (and maybe they are for some future product).


I've liked Cerebars since I first saw the taken down youtube video of the lab lady going over the ""engine block"" of a system. It is innovative strictly in the sense that it disrupts a lot of the status-quo of system design; having so many cores on a single wafer changes your networking demands, which necessarily will change everything else (I'd guess some parts are easier and some harder, but considering how much nvidia IP surrounds the main chip in their systems, it is probably significant).


It will pose no greater threat than all the hyperscaler ASICs, imo. The truly hard part of what Nvidia does is the extreme focus on compatibility across the stack and generations, as well as the ability to disaggregate the reference design to ensure a good fit for any and every datacenter owner. And all of the software suites and developments they release to reach all the way to the end-user/researcher, empowering them to use accelerated computing with minimal effort.


Besides pure inference datacenters, which are likely to be ASICs designed for well-understood and commercially viable models, all of these extra things Nvidia brings to the table makes them an amazing choice to fill up your DC - if any given user base falls off usage for one reason or another, the compute supply is easily soaked up by all the other applications that can run on Nvidia systems, giving great ROI/TCO. A busy DC is a profitable DC.



Hyperscalers wouldn't by buying as much as they are at the prices they pay if it didn't make sense, including medium- to long-term as DC build outs must return value for many years. And if it were so easy to compete with Nvidia for this demand, AMD would be doing a lot better than they have. It is no longer speculative to say Nvidia's moat is both wide and deep, it is empirically true. And with their new hoardes of cash for reinvestment, I can't imagine anyone catching up without serious errors from Nvidia. || For automation plays, I like a few industrial names like AIT, ITT, ITRI, and APH. || Put leaps. || buy high buy higher! || I am mad I didn't buy more yesterday.

Highly skeptical. Even the US aid that has been approved has been trickling in very slowly while Ukraines defense industry has been ramping up and becoming more self sufficient over the past 3 years, which means that Ukraine has been fighting with minimal US aid as it already is.

Ukraine have been fighting this war on behalf of the EU and US as well as themselves the whole time. All this has done in reality is weaken Russia. They are constantly bombarding Ukraine with missiles and hoped that Ukraine would not be able to respond in the same way. Of course they are threatening with nukes, this is what they do every time something doesn’t go the way he wants/ expects. Giving in to his wild threats won’t help, if he’s dumb enough to use nukes because of something like this then it’s inevitable but conceding to them indefinitely every time they threaten that would be very stupid and only give them the upper hand they’re hoping for. || The S&P 500 TR index (i.e., including dividends) is up about 30% since peak 2021 levels.

Ukraine does not have a ""defense industry"". It doesn't have the prerequisite workforce or the capital inflows to run one. This is mostly media hopium to avoid acknowledging the U.S. has little material aid to provide.

Bad take. Urals heavy sour cannot be substituted with American light sweet.  

> I could definitely be wrong but a lot of military analysts I've been listening to say that US aid isn't as crucial now as it was earlier on in the war.

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

$8k is the only around 10% of my liquid investment (not counting 401k, etc).

Thanks for any feedback!",bourbon_nobruob,2024-11-20 10:56:11,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvicis/trading_spy_for_gains/,None,"Buy & Hold long term is more effective than buying and selling and doesn't incurr as much taxes.

This is called trading or swing trading or day trading. 95% (may be 99% who knows) of retailers make loss by doing this, not a good option if you do not know how to trade!  

It is not easy as market always cheats the retailer. It is long way to go.

Like others said buy/hold index funds are better or stay as is in HYSA (until you learn properly which is better for you). || Just hold it forget it about lol, way less stress || Day trading SPY 😂 || Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. So look at your marginal tax bracket, that’s the rate that you will be taxed.

So ya, I am trading $8k for micro gains. With zero intentions to cash out with less than $8k but will be cashing out as soon as it makes $50+ on a given time of the day. 

Does that still make sense? || I have been investing in index funds this year with a brokerage (have only invested 401k before). 

Investing on FXIAX and FSPTX.
This SPY play is done with HYSA money, since I don’t see the downside of doing it, as long as I commit to keep the baseline (starting money) and harvest the small gains, moving the gains back to money market or even HYSA.

The downsides I have been hearing applies for an overall portfolio. My case I wanted to keep this cash “liquid-ish”, hence I didn’t add to index fund.

Wondering if anyone ever done such thing and pros/cons when tax time comes. || Haha, putting it like that sounds stupid in fact haha

I guess this is a money I was leaving at a HYSA just in case I needed (not investing it long term).
It was earning $25 per month in interest. Feels like SPY trading would be as safe as it gets to get started.
The problem is that I have these stupid questions related to Taxes and if it’s worth it (when compared to HYSA). || Thank you. 
I knew that part. But I don’t have short term capital gains at the moment and didn’t know how difficult my tax filing will become if I start trading.
HYSA interest are also taxed as ordinary income but I believe they go in different places when filing taxes (schedule D for capital gains?).
Anyways, I am newbie to this but not completely uninformed. Just wondering how come anyone would keep playing with HYSA when SPY (or an index fund for that matter) has always gone up overtime at rates better than HYSA (not considering big catalyst, like a pandemic). 
I am 34 years old, so I got some time until I need to move my money to safe heaven. || And do you do something similar than what I mentioned above by chance? Keep a baseline always there and only sell the excess?

Very new to trading and just thought it would be a better opinion to HYSA. Just don’t know how complicated my tax will be and if overall, when comparing the HYSA, it’s more profitable (looks like it had to be) at least in bullish markets… || Ya, paying tax is not the problem. Filling the tax returns is the question.

I already take a 35-37% hit due to taxes, which is what the short term gains will cost me anyways. 
Not blue collar worker here, but sorry to hear you got hit so much with capital gains tax. || It does not make sense. Learn these

Fear of losing Money

Both will make you loss.

Investing or HYSA is better way. || It just means your investment will not be that great in the next 10 years as you keep withdrawing from your pool. Btw you should hold $voo instead if you plan on holding it long term due to the cheaper expense ratio. || I have many years of investing and some years of trading experience, altogether 10+ years.

Even though I am trying to break that rule, like you, past eight years (trading), it is hard to understand markets.

Even with nice system like this, which is not visible for normal eyes, unable to exceed market.

All I say, it is extremely hard to understand and make money in the market with exceptionally better tools.

S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.



S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.



Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable.



Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):

Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%



**My target candidates for inclusion:**

\* things like negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility

|Ticker|Company|Industry|Sector|Market Cap|P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|APP|AppLovin|Technology|Software|$100B|$88|
|APO|Apollo|Financial|Asset Management|$92B|$17.2|
|WDAY|Workday|Technology|Software|$66B|$45.2|
|TTD|Trade Desk|Technology|Software|$55B|$191|
|ARES|Ares|Financial|Financial|$52B|$75|
|VRT|Vertiv|Industrials|Electrical Equipment|$45B|$80.4|

**Trade Idea**: Buy shares $APO, $VRT, $TTD, $ARES. For more exposure/upside buy Jan 17 '25 calls

I have traded this kind of new additions to the S&P indexes before and made money.  If I knew ahead of time with a good guess, I could have done much better.  Thanks for the heads up! || I'm surprised TTD wasn't included already. It's been a part of the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) for some time now, which typically has tougher entry requirements, ignoring the Nasdaq listing stipulation. || Wouldnt it be safe to bet on the lower three as its going to be dropped as well ? No idea what they are but buying puts on them should yield a return as well. || S&P rebalancing is always an interesting game...it’s like musical chairs, but with billions of dollars at stake. Your picks are solid, especially with their market caps and sector representation. Vertiv ($VRT) in particular stands out to me industrials are underweighted in the S&P, and their growth trajectory in electrical equipment fits right into the infrastructure boom. It’s the kind of company that could slide into the mix to rebalance sector representation.

Another angle could be emerging industries like AI infrastructure. Companies diving into scalable AI solutions, such as Kinetic Seas with their purpose-built data centers, are becoming increasingly relevant in tech-heavy indices like the S&P 500. While they may not meet the current market cap requirements yet, these kinds of players could be the “next wave” of candidates in the coming years.

Curious—what’s your take on sector balancing? Do you think the index will continue leaning heavily into tech, or will we see a more even distribution? || I sure wish I had bought more VRT three days ago when you posted this…nice work OP despite some of the comments above. || Volume is a requirement.

Is there still an opportunity to be made? || why not buy APP? also, typically will the pump come before or after index inclusion? || Are you saying there is typically a 5-10% increase for those companies? Or for the S&P? || Yesssss! Please, we need Vertiv in the S&P500! I definitely don't have a large amount of VRT shares... || I think KKR is more likely than APO and ARES to get in. If they let in a new PE firm. || So what exactly do I do in this situation. Im pretty new to investing, and want to learn more on it. || Just so you know the big players already have huge positions they build up over time to sell to whoever manages the listed index. They pay a lot of money for this info and you are going to have a bad time trying to “beat” them. || no problem! it’s pretty simple to get a list of eligible companies. You can use FinViz to create a screener and filter for US, market cap, etc. to fulfill the SP 500 requirements || Exactly, a surprise to me as well. They have also shown good momentum recently.

In terms of sector balance I think it will remain heavily tech focused.

No doubt energy as well with the insane demand from big tech, AI/compute, and even crypto mining || this reads like chatgpt. || thanks, cheers || volume is factored in already, this is filtered to include avg volume of 250k or greater   

my ideas are - like you said - just my ideas. none of this is financial advice or a guarantee. 

provide your own research or idea rather than stating the obvious || I doubt it because if the volatility and it trades with $BTC || oh also they have negative trailing EPS, gotta have positive EPS for last 4 quarters 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/financials/) || not guaranteed but historically additions get a solid 5% + move. momentum is actually a good thing and can be a factor for index inclusion 

More important is probably the company’s beta with the market and with $NVDA. For example, $VRT trades closely with NVIDIA and so if you buy this week ahead of ER and $NVDA sells off $VRT might too. Just food for thought since the rebalancing won’t occur for 2-3 weeks || $APP was up like 200% recently after ER and idk seems like potentially too volatile for the selection committee. I could be wrong though 

there might be some price increase in anticipation of the inclusion but if there’s a real pump it will be after the announcement (typically AH on Friday lol) 

so stocks get some momentum AH and then the following week || for the companies || ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face) || KKR was already added in June || Basically capitalize on the market swings for a positive catalyst like being included in the S&P, which forces funds to buy X amount shares.

I prefer to treat Reddit as it's meant to be. For entertainment. || Thanks for the amazing post. I now follow you sir || based on S&P calendar isn’t the inclusion planned for 20 Dec? will the announcement be so early? || Figured as much, thank you || So js buy the stocks OP has highlighted? And what are buy call options 😭 || Talking down to me when you didn’t comprehend what I just wrote. The insider “increased buying/volume” is already happening. What you see on index addition is retail/active managers/etc. You need to be buying well beforehand otherwise you’re basically doing a coin flip on whether the stock goes up or down just like any other day.

I work in this industry btw. How do you think these massive funds make money? They use the guidelines to predict what will be added/removed next rebalance (about 100000x more info than you have) and then buy the shares to sell to whoever is listing the index. They are not all buying on the day it gets announced. The only indexes that somewhat follow the behavior you imply is Russel and that’s why everyone hates them. || Most likely the value premium. Stocks being added have often seen huge surges in valuations prior to addition, and removals have seen huge surges in decline prior to being removed.

Then you have people trying to sell/buy before the rebalancing, that exacerbate this mispricing. || He left out the over time part, not initially (maybe that’s obvious to you or people reading, but I thought clarifying could be helpful). || fair enough.

That’s wrong, no one is trying to beat HFs or the market or the index selection committees

You are correct that for this trade to have any alpha one has to buy ahead of time which is why I’m posting this now a few weeks ahead of the announcement. 

The point is to have a small group of stocks with potential inclusion (as accurate as one can get without being a quant firm) and then sell the news. As always I could be wrong and this is just my speculation. Cheers || Ahh, yeah that makes sense. Though, I've often wondered if the sheer increase in outside volatility and reduction in fundamental correlation might be enough to mildly depress a price in the long term. As in, maybe some stock pickers would rather trade high quality assets that aren't tied as tightly to the movements of the broader market. || I got that, but I'm still curious if there is a correlation or what the reason might be, if any. || MSTR? || You kinda are trying to “beat” them bc you’re implying they are leaving money on the table that you will be able to get a piece of based on “vibes” of what will be added. These funds pay lots of money to know what will be added well before you do. This is a crowded market, and it’s not retail making it crowded. || Doubt it. There’s a level of healthy skepticism around a company that’s so volatile and trades with BTC regardless of if bitcoin is pumping || [deleted] || Hey man if you want to lie to yourself it’s all good. You are implying you’re gonna beat them. How else would you explain why you could make money off this trade? Why wouldn’t the institutions make the same trade you are if it’s such a good trade? You’re saying that you know better than them and can squeeze additional money out of this trade reliably. Why wouldn’t Citadel have already done this trade if it’s so good?

What you are doing is the same as buying before earnings to bet on the outcome. It’s gambling.

The fact you think it’s insider trading means you are completely clueless, jumping from a sink into the Pacific Ocean. || [deleted]"

It is a float for Insurance businesses. Berkshire is not asset management, other insurance companies more or less invest mostly in Fixed Income.

I am not sure what the hell everyone around here is talking about. Berkshire delivers consistent returns on equity, which is what matters || It's of course hard, when you are big, and you still try to avoid most tech stock, which are the majority (or very large) position of the available stocks to invest. || The issue is it supposedly wasn’t his pick. If the majority of his gains aren’t from his own brain, that matters. || After adjusting Buffet's stats, removing outliers to project the future, he heavily regresses to around the level of 2018 Kramer. || 1.1B / $26.82 (apple price 2016) * 228.82 (apple current price)
= 9.38B

during that time Berkshire went from $194k to $706k. 

I’m not sure I follow.. now what? || This is the key distinction that everyone is missing.  On a risk adjusted basis, BRK is practically untouchable. || Not even close, Berkshire currently only holds $16 Billion in Bonds so 1.6% of it's $1 Trillion market cap. BRK's cash position is nearly 20 times the size of their bond holdings. || I followed him with OXY and am hurting because of it. || He missed many of the tech gains that drove the S&P 500 over the last 20 years because of his long time aversion to tech stocks… he was somewhat late to Apple, but still in time to rack up massive gains from it. || I almost bought ulta when he did. It’s in the 350’s now. I do still believe it’s undervalued but being right at the wrong time is the same as being wrong. || It's about risk management. When the S&P500 returns -50%, Berkshire will return -15%. || The goal is consistent growth. || Yeah, I shouldn’t have made him sound like a fund manager, he’s not directly managing people’s money. But I think that’s being pedantic about the idea being conveyed. He’s not trying to maximize his gains, he’s trying to keep a healthy balance of minimal losses and healthy gains. || But if he's going to die soon, isn't it good that he trusts his managers to make good picks? I still don't see the issue || Doesn’t matter. He is the one that had to make the final decision || You can’t throw out outliers. Buffet is all about outliers. He doesn’t believe in diversification. || Sorry, I changed my response as I saw they bought on several occassion so we would need the full list of their transactions.  I'm not even sure if that's public information. || You're looking at the wrong thing. I think that's their operating cash for their core businesses or something. They have ~272 billion cash/equivalents total.

I bought BRK and have done well, but I would never buy one of his individual picks.

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",obliviousredditor3,2024-11-18 09:52:41,272,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/,None,"Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.

In this case their car drives on its own so they have to be completely on the hook for any damages caused by the car. If a car self driving car requires me to be liable or requires my own insurance then it is not a self driving car.

It will be fun trying to avoid accidents with these unregulated self driving cars. || Lol, we are just crash test dummies || Anything they put on the road should not only be safe under various driving conditions, but also needs to be safe from hackers. 


Rushing to put these out on the road is setting up for a series of dangerous events. I honestly think these can be safe in the long run, but bypassing safety will sabotage the advancement of this industry. || This is what $75 million buys. || Is this becoming similar to Boeing approving its own new type of airplanes? Of course this in Tesla's and Musk short term interest || if there are no regulatory barriers left, what excuse will musk use for missing launch dates? || [removed] || AUR +10.8% pre market

Edit: now +26% || So I guess they are not even going to try to pretend to be independent and no just self serving, huh? Thanks America. || Robotaxi anyone? What’s a few dead people among friends ? || [removed] || I don’t get why people think current rules are what is stopping Tesla? There are already other manufacturers with self driving cars on the road with the exact same rules. || Ahhhh is this what Leave the World Behind was about? || expect a lot of insurance fraud || Would this be the equivalent of the hospital making you sign a waiver before a risky procedure, to cover their ass in case the surgery goes wrong? || Musk is killing the competition after killing the EV subsidy and now changes the rules to have more of his cars on the street. Very efficient indeed! || Hopefully they put these self driving vehicles in Alabama || Trump team = elon musk…. Your EVs can and will fall apart years earlier than ICE vehicles and you Will like it || My TSLT about to rip above 30. || Might be disagreement but I think full self driving cars will never co-exist amongst human driven cars. 

I think if full self driving does ever happen, it will start out with 'Fully self driving' areas and then expand over time as more people buy cars with the tech. || I thought r/Stocks believe Tesla FSD is so bad and Waymo is the true leader in self driving. 

So they should be celebrating this development because Waymo can be deployed in all 50 states all at once instead of undergoing 50 different set of rules under each jurisdiction. 

But keep complaining because it's obvious you do not have first hand experience in FSD 12.5.6 in HW 4 cars. || I love my Tesla stock, euphoric this past week  || Because Elon wants to be able to make tons of money quickly and not be responsible / sued for tons of money when things are rushed and things go wrong and people who are not him or his family die.

Now if his family dies, he will be doing the suing, but if other people die he doesn't want to get sued || Nah Tesla just turns off self driving and blames the driver. || > or requires my own insurance

This sounds reasonable to me. Have self driving insurance if you want that option. Shitty self driving cars would be uninsurable or cost prohibitive to own. || People ride in deregulated FSD should ensure their affairs are in order. Personally, I wouldn’t take that risk. || I disagree,  any self-driving car out there tells you you need to pay attention to the road to take over if necessary. And anybody who's actually used it will tell you it's not perfect


It's just like Hondas ""lane keep assist"" or the advanced cruise control. it's a worse version of auto pilot, but if I were to get in an accident it's my fault. || Is it the same as the doctor asking family to sign a waiver before performing a risky surgery, that they won’t sue the doctor if there are problems with the surgery? || [removed] || Of course you are. A good old meat-bag with a wallet. That self-driving future companies are looking forward to is turning more and more dystopian. || Yes we are, but not Elon or his family. If Elon or his family get hurt by EVs that aren't Teslas, you know he's gonna sue even if he says EVs shouldn't be sued || To be fair, they haven't really cared in a while.

Car fatalities are on the way up with pedestrian death being the most impacted in the US. Who could have predicted that putting more and more bigger and bigger cars on the road would cause that? Oh yeah, physics.

Maybe next we shall introduce the self driving cars to spice things up again. At least it might solve the social security and heath care cost issues if people die young enough. || They just care about money.  
Nothing extra || Better than 1 billion || [removed] || https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotaxi#:~:text=As%20of%202023%20there%20has,2018%20%E2%80%93%20have%20not%20been%20realized

Apparently there's only been one in the last 6 years || I mean, you kind of answered your own question. 

There are current cars that operate fine under exact same rules. But Tesla can't hack it under the existing rules so they are seeking to lower the standard. || It already has…waymo cars are doing 100 000s rides per week || Well based on Teslas own communication FSD is just assistant driving and Waymo is the company with the most drive autonomous miles in the US. So it’s not an opinion but simple facts. || 👍 || That's a terrible idea actually.

Doing that would mean removing one huge incentive for car makers to improve their self-driving system and move the liability into the consumer.

They are the only one that have the ability to improve their system especially when the technology will be all closed. If you remove the liability from the car maker, what incentive do they have to improve their system?

Even worse, they could just tell the consumer that their model is not safe enough and they should just by the next model instead of fixing it.

If carmakers want to sell self driving cars (with no driver), they should only do so if it's safe and they should be the one paying for insurance. || The thing is companies are dropping Tesla for insurance because it's not worth it.


Until Tesla gets lidar and radar it won't be fully capable of self driving 


You simply can't run what he wants off a camera it's technology impossible 


It's also why self driving cars and busses in Cali are doing so well because they have all three || You can’t opt out of being in a collision with one || your name says it all || I'm sorry for this comment it's just terrible. How does the size of a car relate anyway to how many accidents there were

What actual evidence do you have that bigger cars or more likely to be in accidents


You're just going on the base assumption that because a car is heavier it's more deadly but there is way more Nuance than that || How so? || [removed] || Consumers will choose cars with cheaper insurance, which means improvements will continue. || He didn't say accidents he said pedestrian deaths. If you can't figure out why a F-350 is more likely to kill a pedestrian it hits compared to a Civic then you should go back to school. || You tell me how spending 1 billion in a presidential loss with 20 mil in debt is somehow better.

MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI. I’m expecting an announcement in the next month on who the new logo is and I think it’s pretty likely the largest name in the industry!",girldadx4,2024-11-18 20:35:29,19,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gu6rqi/mcd_and_soun/,None,"I've only ever seen people on reddit shit on SOUN which is enough to make it a strong buy for me || I used to think SoundHound was just a crappy company that rode the AI wave. Now I look at their partnerships and they're with a lot of the big car guys, most restaurants with their Yum! partnership, and it seems like they're seeing success with the restaurant/service industry. Definitely a stock to look at. || The most recent criticism I have seen is that AI is easy and the market will be saturated. Those are the people using chat gpt and seeing the cool stuff they can do with minimal effort. They have no understanding of the level of R&D required for reliable hardware integration with consistent results.

Last quarter the criticism was related to them earning most of their revenue from one client(72% of revenue). They then adjusted and came back with their top client accounting for 12% of revenue and 87% year over year revenue growth.."
